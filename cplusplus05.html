<p><br><a name="alloc/intro"></a>
    In contrast to the set of functions which handle memory allocation in <strong>C</strong>
(i.e., <code>malloc()</code> etc.), the operators <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code> are
specifically meant to be used with the features that <strong>C++</strong> offers. 
Important differences between <code>malloc()</code> and <code>new</code> are:
<p><br><ul>
    <li > The function <code>malloc()</code> doesn't `know' what the allocated memory
will be used for. E.g., when memory for <code>int</code>s is allocated, the programmer
must supply the correct expression using a multiplication by
<code>sizeof(int)</code>. In contrast, <code>new</code> requires the use of a type; the
<code>sizeof</code> expression is implicitly handled by the compiler.
    <li > The only way to initialize memory which is allocated by <code>malloc()</code>
is to use <code>calloc()</code>, which allocates memory and resets it to a given
value. In contrast, <code>new</code> can call the constructor of an allocated object
where initial actions are defined. This constructor may be supplied with
arguments.
    <li > All <strong>C</strong>-allocation functions must be inspected for
<code>NULL</code>-returns. In contrast, the <code>new</code>-operator provides a facility called
a <em>new_handler</em> (cf. section <a href="cplusplus04.html#NEWHANDLER">4.3.3</a>) which can be used instead of
the explicit checks for <code>NULL</code>-returns.
</ul>
<p><br>The relationship between <code>free()</code> and <code>delete</code> is analogous: <code>delete</code>
makes sure that when an object is deallocated, a corresponding destructor is
called.
<p><br>The automatic calling of constructors and destructors when objects are created
and destroyed, has a number of consequences which we shall discuss in this
chapter. Many problems encountered during <strong>C</strong> program development are caused
by incorrect memory allocation or memory leaks: memory is not allocated, not
freed, not initialized, boundaries are overwritten, etc..  <strong>C++</strong> does not
`magically' solve these problems, but it <em>does</em> provide a number of handy
tools.
<p><br>Unfortunately, the very frequently used <code>str...()</code> functions, like
<code>strdup()</code> are all <code>malloc()</code> based, and should therefore preferably 
not be used anymore in <strong>C++</strong> programs. Instead, a new set of corresponding
functions, based on the operator <code>new</code>, are preferred. 
<p><br><a name="STRDUPNEW"></a>
For the function <code>strdup()</code> a comparable function <code>char *strdupnew(char 
const *str)</code> could be developed as follows:
<pre>

    char *strdupnew(char const *str)
    {
        return (strcpy(new char [strlen(str) + 1], str));
    }

</pre>

Similar functions could be developed for comparable <code>malloc()</code>-based
<code>str...()</code> and other functions.
<p><br>In this chapter we discuss the following topics:
<p><br><ul>
<p><br><li > the assignment operator (and operator overloading in general),
<p><br><li > the <code>this</code> pointer,
<p><br><li > the copy constructor.
<p><br></ul>

<h2>5.1: Classes with pointer data members</h2>
    <a name="alloc/pointerdata"></a>
    In this section we shall again use the class <code>Person</code> as example:
<p><br><pre>

    class Person
    {
        public:
            // constructors and destructor
            Person();
            Person(char const *n, char const *a,
                   char const *p);
            ~Person();

            // interface functions
            void setname(char const *n);
            void setaddress(char const *a);
            void setphone(char const *p);

            char const *getname(void) const;
            char const *getaddress(void) const;
            char const *getphone(void) const;

        private:
            // data fields
            char *name;
            char *address;
            char *phone;
    };

</pre>

<p><br>In this class the destructor is necessary to prevent that memory,
once allocated for the fields <code>name</code>, <code>address</code> and <code>phone</code>, becomes
unreachable when an object ceases to exist. In the following example a
<code>Person</code> object is created, after which the data fields are printed. After
this the <code>main()</code> function stops, which leads to the deallocation of
memory. The destructor of the class is also shown for illustration purposes.
<p><br>Note that in this example an object of the class <code>Person</code> is also created
and destroyed using a pointer variable; using the operators <code>new</code> and
<code>delete</code>.
<p><br><pre>

    Person::~Person()
    {
        delete name;
        delete address;
        delete phone;
    }

    int main()
    {
        Person
            kk("Karel", "Rietveldlaan",
                "050 542 6044"),
            *bill = new Person("Bill Clinton",
                   "White House",
                   "09-1-202-142-3045");

        printf("%s, %s, %s\n"
               "%s, %s, %s\n",
            kk.getname(), kk.getaddress(), kk.getphone(),
            bill-&gt;getname(), bill-&gt;getaddress(), bill-&gt;getphone());

        delete bill;

        return (0);
    }

</pre>

<p><br>The memory occupied by the object <code>kk</code> is released automatically
when <code>main()</code> terminates: the <strong>C++</strong> compiler makes sure that the
destructor is called. Note, however, that the object pointed to by <code>bill</code> is
handled differently. The variable <code>bill</code> is a pointer; and a pointer
variable is, even in <strong>C++</strong>, in itself no <code>Person</code>. Therefore, before
<code>main()</code> terminates, the memory occupied by the object pointed to by
<code>bill</code> must be <em>explicitly</em> released; hence the statement <code>delete</code>
<code>bill</code>. The operator <code>delete</code> will make sure that the destructor is
called, thereby releasing the three strings of the object.
<p><br>
<p><br><a name="l80"></a>
<h2>5.2: The assignment operator</h2>
    <a name="alloc/assignment"></a>
    Variables which are <code>struct</code>s or <code>classes</code> can be directly assigned in
<strong>C++</strong> in the same way that <code>struct</code>s can be assigned in <strong>C</strong>. The
default action of such an assignment is a straight bytewise copy from one
compound variable to another.
<p><br>Let us now consider the consequences of this default action in a program
statement such as the following:
<p><br><pre>

    void printperson(Person const &amp;p)
    {
        Person
            tmp;

        tmp = p;
        printf("Name:     %s\n"
                "Address:  %s\n"
                "Phone:    %s\n",
            tmp.getname(), tmp.getaddress(), tmp.getphone());
    }

</pre>

<p><br>We shall follow the execution of this function step by step.
<p><br><ul>
<p><br><li > The function <code>printperson()</code> expects a reference to a
    <code>Person</code> as its parameter <code>p</code>. So far, nothing extraordinary is
    happening.
<p><br><li > The function defines a local object <code>tmp</code>. This means that the
    default constructor of <code>Person</code> is called, which -if defined properly-
    resets the pointer fields <code>name</code>, <code>address</code> and <code>phone</code> of the
    <code>tmp</code> object to zero.
<p><br><li > Next, the object referenced by <code>p</code> is copied to <code>tmp</code>. By
    default this means that <code>sizeof(Person)</code> bytes from <code>p</code> are copied
    to <code>tmp</code>.
<p><br>Now a potentially dangerous situation has arisen. Note that the actual
    values in <code>p</code> are <em>pointers</em>, pointing to allocated memory.
    Following the assignment this memory is addressed by two objects: <code>p</code>
    <em>and</em> <code>tmp</code>.
<p><br><li > The potentially dangerous situation develops into an acutely
    dangerous situation when the function <code>printperson()</code> terminates:
    the object <code>tmp</code> is destroyed. The destructor of the class <code>Person</code>
    releases the memory pointed to by the fields <code>name</code>, <code>address</code> and
    <code>phone</code>: unfortunately, this memory is also in use by <code>p</code>....
<p><br>The incorrect assignment is illustrated in figure <a href="cplusplus05.html#badassign">3</a>.
    <a name="badassign"></a><p><center><img src="images/badassign.gif" align="bottom" alt="figure 3 is shown here."><br> 
figure 3: Private data and public interface functions of the class Person,
    using bytewise assignment 
</center><p><br>
    
<p><br></ul>
<p><br>Having executed <code>printperson()</code>, the object which was
referenced by <code>p</code> now contain pointers to deallocated memory. 
<p><br>This action is undoubtedly not a desired
effect of a function like the above. The deallocated memory will likely become
occupied during subsequent allocations: the pointer members of <code>p</code> have
effectively become <em>wild pointers</em>, as they don't point to allocated memory
anymore.
<p><br>In general it can be concluded that <em>every class containing pointer 
data members is a potential candidate for trouble</em>. It is of course possible
to prevent such troubles, as will be discussed in the next section.

<p><br><a name="l81"></a>
<h3>5.2.1: Overloading the assignment operator</h3>
        <a name="alloc/overload"></a>
    
Obviously, the right way to assign one <code>Person</code> object to another, is
<strong>not</strong> to copy the contents of the object bytewise. A better way is to
make an equivalent object; one with its own allocated  memory, but which
contains the same strings.
<p><br>The `right' way to duplicate a <code>Person</code> object is illustrated in 
    figure <a href="cplusplus05.html#rightass">4</a>.
    <a name="rightass"></a><p><center><img src="images/rightass.gif" align="bottom" alt="figure 4 is shown here."><br> 
figure 4: Private data and public interface functions of the class Person,
     using the `correct' assignment. 
</center><p><br>
    
<p><br>There is a number of solutions for the above wish. One solution consists of
the definition of a special function to handle assignments of objects of the
class <code>Person</code>. The purpose of this function would be to create a copy of
an object, but one with its own <code>name</code>, <code>address</code> and <code>phone</code>
strings. Such a member function might be:
<p><br><pre>

    void Person::assign(Person const &amp;other)
    {
        // delete our own previously used memory
        delete name;
        delete address;
        delete phone;

        // now copy the other Person's data
        name = strdupnew(other.name);
        address = strdupnew(other.address);
        phone = strdupnew(other.phone);
    }

</pre>

<p><br>Using this tool we could rewrite the offending function <code>printperson()</code>:
<p><br><pre>

    void printperson(Person const &amp;p)
    {
        Person
            tmp;

        // make tmp a copy of p, but with its own allocated
        // strings
        tmp.assign(p);
        
        printf("Name:     %s\n"
                "Address:  %s\n"
                "Phone:    %s\n",
            tmp.getname(), tmp.getaddress(), tmp.getphone());

        // now it doesn't matter that tmp gets destroyed..
    }

</pre>

<p><br>In itself this solution is valid, although it is a purely symptomatic solution.
This
solution requires that the programmer uses a specific member function instead
of the operator <code>=</code>. The problem, however, remains if this rule is not
strictly adhered to. Experience learns that <em>errare humanum est</em>: a
solution which doesn't enforce exceptions is therefore preferable.
<p><br>The problem of the assignment operator is solved by means of <em>operator
overloading</em>: the syntactic possibility <strong>C++</strong> offers 
to redefine the actions of
an operator in a given context. Operator overloading was mentioned earlier,
when the operators <code>&lt;&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;</code> were redefined for the
usage with streams as <code>cin</code>, <code>cout</code> and <code>cerr</code> (see section 
<a href="cplusplus03.html#CoutCinCerr">3.1.2</a>).
<p><br>Overloading the assignment operator is probably the most common form of
operator overloading. However, a word of warning is appropriate: the fact that
<strong>C++</strong> allows operator overloading does not mean that this feature should be
used at all times. A few rules are:
<p><br><ul>
<p><br><li > Operator overloading should be used in situations where an operator
    has a defined action, but when this action is not desired as it has
    negative side effects. A typical example is the above assignment operator
    in the context of the class <code>Person</code>.
<p><br><li > Operator overloading can be used in situations where the usage of
    the operator is common and when no ambiguity in the meaning of the
    operator is introduced by redefining it. An example may be the
    redefinition of the operator <code>+</code> for a class which represents a complex
    number. The meaning of a <code>+</code> between two complex numbers is quite
    clear and unambiguous.
<p><br><li > In all other cases it is preferable to define a member function,
    instead of redefining an operator.
<p><br></ul>
<p><br>Using these rules, operator overloading is minimized which helps keep source
files readable. An operator simply does what it is designed to do. Therefore,
in our vision, the operators insertion (<code>&lt;&lt;</code>) and extraction (<code>&gt;&gt;</code>)
operators in the context of streams are unfortunate: the stream 
operations do not have anything in common with the bitwise shift operations.

<p><br>
<a name="l82"></a>

             
<strong>5.2.1.1: The function 'operator=()'</strong><p>
            <a name="alloc/operator"></a>
    To achieve operator overloading in the context of a class, the class is simply
expanded with a <code>public</code> function stating the particular operator. A
corresponding function, the implementation of the overloaded operator,
is thereupon defined.
<p><br>For example, to overload the addition operator <code>+</code>, a function
<code>operator+()</code> must be defined. The function name consists of two parts:
the keyword <code>operator</code>, followed by the operator itself.
<p><br>In our case we define a new function <code>operator=()</code> to redefine the actions
of the assignment operator. A possible extension to the class <code>Person</code>
could therefore be:
<p><br><pre>

    // new declaration of the class
    class Person
    {
        public:
            ...
            void operator=(Person const &amp;other);
            ...
        private:
            ...
    };

    // definition of the function operator=()
    void Person::operator=(Person const &amp;other)
    {
        // deallocate old data
        delete name;
        delete address;
        delete phone;

        // make duplicates of other's data
        name = strdupnew(other.name);
        address = strdupnew(other.address);
        phone = strdupnew(other.phone);
    }

</pre>

<p><br>The function <code>operator=()</code> presented here is the first version of
the overloaded assignment operator. 
We shall present better and less bug-prone versions shortly.
<p><br>The actions of this member function are similar to those of the previously
proposed function <code>assign()</code>, but now its <em>name</em> makes sure that this 
function is
also activated when the assignment operator <code>=</code> is used. There are actually
two ways to call this function, as illustrated below:
<p><br><pre>

    Person
        pers("Frank", "Oostumerweg 17", "403 2223"),
        copy;
        
    // first possibility
    copy = pers;

    // second possibility
    copy.operator=(pers);

</pre>

<p><br>It is obvious that the second possibility, in which <code>operator=()</code> is
explicitly stated, is not used often. However, the code fragment <em>does</em>
illustrate the two ways of calling the same function.

<p><br><a name="l83"></a>
<h2>5.3: The this pointer</h2>
    <a name="alloc/this"></a>
    As we have seen, a member function of a given class is always called in the
context of some object of the class. There is always an implicit `substrate'
for the function to act on. <strong>C++</strong> defines a keyword, <code>this</code>, to address
this substrate (Note that `<code>this</code>' is not available in the not yet 
discussed <code>static</code> member functions.) 
<p><br>The <code>this</code> keyword is a pointer
variable, which always contains the address of the object in question. The
<code>this</code> pointer is implicitly declared in each member function (whether
<code>public</code> or <code>private</code>). Therefore, it is as if in each member function of
the class <code>Person</code> would contain the following declaration:
<p><br><pre>

    extern Person *this;

</pre>

<p><br>A member function like <code>setname()</code>, which sets a <code>name</code> field of a
<code>Person</code> to a given string, could therefore be implemented in two ways:
with or without the <code>this</code> pointer:
<p><br><pre>

    // alternative 1: implicit usage of this
    void Person::setname(char const *n)
    {
        delete name;
        name = strdupnew(n);
    }

    // alternative 2: explicit usage of this
    void Person::setname(char const *n)
    {
        delete this-&gt;name;
        this-&gt;name = strdupnew(n);
    }

</pre>

<p><br>Explicit usage of the <code>this</code> pointer is not used very frequently. 
However, there exist a number of situations where the <code>this</code> pointer is 
really needed.

<p><br><a name="l84"></a>
<h3>5.3.1: Preventing self-destruction with this</h3>
        <a name="alloc/prevent"></a>
    
As we have seen, the operator <code>=</code> can be redefined for the class
<code>Person</code> in such a way that two objects of the class can be assigned,
leading to two copies of the same object.
<p><br>As long as the two variables are different ones, the previously presented
version of the function <code>operator=()</code> will behave properly: the memory of
the assigned object is released, after which it is allocated again to hold new
strings. However, when an object is assigned to itself (which is called
auto-assignment), a problem occurs: the allocated strings of the receiving
object are
first released, but this also leads to the release  of the strings of the
right-hand side variable, which we call <em>self-destruction</em>.
An example of this situation is illustrated below:
<p><br><pre>

    void fubar(Person const &amp;p)
    {
        p = p;          // auto-assignment!
    }

</pre>

<p><br>In this example it is perfectly clear that something unnecessary, possibly
even wrong, is happening. But auto-assignment can also occur in more hidden
forms:
<p><br><pre>

    Person
        one,
        two,
        *pp;

    pp = &amp;one;
    ...
    *pp = two;
    ...
    one = *pp;

</pre>

<p><br>The problem of the auto-assignment can be solved using the <code>this</code>
pointer. In the overloaded assignment operator function we simply test whether
the address of the right-hand side object is the same as the address of the
current object: if so, no action needs to be taken. The definition of the
function <code>operator=()</code> then becomes:
<p><br><pre>

    void Person::operator=(Person const &amp;other)
    {
        // only take action if address of current object
        // (this) is NOT equal to address of other
        // object(&amp;other):

        if (this != &amp;other)
        {
            delete name;
            delete address;
            delete phone;

            name = strdupnew(other.name);
            address = strdupnew(other.address);
            phone = strdupnew(other.phone);
        }
    }

</pre>

<p><br>This is the second version of the overloaded assignment function. One, yet
better version remains to be discussed.
<p><br>As a subtlety, note the usage of the <em>address operator</em> '<code>&amp;</code>' 
in the statement
<p><br><pre>

    if (this != &amp;other)

</pre>

<p><br>The variable <code>this</code> is a pointer to the `current' object, while <code>other</code>
is a reference; which is an `alias' to an actual <code>Person</code> object. The
address of the other object is therefore <code>&amp;other</code>, while the address of
the current object is <code>this</code>.

<p><br><a name="l85"></a>
<h3>5.3.2: Associativity of operators and this</h3>
        <a name="alloc/associat"></a>
    According to <strong>C++</strong>'s syntax, the associativity of the assignment
operator is to the right-hand side. I.e., in statements like:
<p><br><pre>

    a = b = c;

</pre>

<p><br>the expression <code>b = c</code> is evaluated first, and the result is assigned to
<code>a</code>.
<p><br>The implementation of the overloaded assignment operator so far does not
permit such constructions, as an assignment using the member function returns
nothing (<code>void</code>). We can therefore conclude that the previous
implementation does circumvent an allocation problem, but is
syntactically  not quite right.
<p><br>The syntactical problem can be illustrated as follows. When we rewrite the
expression <code>a = b = c</code> to the form which explicitly
mentions the overloaded assignment member functions, we get:
<p><br><pre>

    a.operator=(b.operator=(c));

</pre>

<p><br>This variant is syntactically wrong, since the sub-expression 
<code>b.operator=(c)</code>
yields <code>void</code>; and the class <code>Person</code> contains no member functions with
the prototype <code>operator=(void)</code>.
<p><br>This problem can also be remedied using the <code>this</code> pointer. The
overloaded assignment function expects as its argument a reference to a
<code>Person</code> object. It can also <em>return</em> a reference to such an
object. This reference can then be used as an argument for a nested
assignment.
<p><br>It is customary to let the overloaded assignment return a reference to the
current object (i.e., <code>*this</code>), as a <code>const</code> reference: the receiver 
is not supposed to alter the <code>*this</code> object.
<p><br>The (final)
version of the overloaded assignment operator for the class <code>Person</code> thus
becomes:
<p><br><pre>

    // declaration in the class
    class Person
    {
        public:
            ...
            Person const &amp;operator=(Person const &amp;other)
            ...
    };

    // definition of the function
    Person const &amp;Person::operator=(Person const &amp;other)
    {
        // only take action when no auto-assignment occurs

        {
            // deallocate own data

            delete name;
            delete phone;

            // duplicate other's data
            address = strdupnew(other.address);
            name = strdupnew(other.name);
            phone = strdupnew(other.phone);
        }

        // return current object, compiler will make sure
        // that a const reference is returned
        return (*this);

<h2>5.4: The copy constructor: Initialization vs. Assignment</h2>
    <a name="alloc/initialisation"></a>
    In the following sections we shall take a  closer look at another usage of the
operator <code>=</code>. For this, we shall use a class <code>String</code>. This class is
meant to handle allocated strings, and its interface is as follows:
<p><br><pre>

    class String
    {
        public:
            // constructors, destructor
            String();
            String(char const *s);
            ~String();

            // overloaded assignment
            String const &amp;operator=(String const &amp;other);

            // interface functions
            void set(char const *data);
            char const *get(void);

        private:
            // one data field: ptr to allocated string
            char *str;
    };

</pre>

<p><br>Concerning this interface we remark the following:
<p><br><ul>
<p><br><li > The class contains a pointer <code>char *str</code>, possibly pointing to 
    allocated memory. Consequently, the class needs a constructor and a
    destructor.
<p><br>A typical action of the constructor would be to set the <code>str</code>
    pointer to 0. A typical action of the destructor would be to release the
    allocated memory.
<p><br><li > For the same reason the class has an overloaded assignment
    operator. The code of this function would look like:
<p><br><pre>

        String const &amp;String::operator=(String const &amp;other)
        {
            if (this != &amp;other)
            {
                delete str;
                str = strdupnew(other.str);
            }
            return (*this);
        }
    
</pre>

<p><br><li > The class has, besides a default constructor, a constructor which
    expects one string argument. Typically this argument would be used to set
    the string to a given value, as in:
<p><br><pre>

        String
            a("Hello World!\n");
    
</pre>

<p><br><li > The only interface functions are to set the string part of the
    object and to retrieve it.
<p><br></ul>
<p><br>Now let's consider the following code fragment. The statement references are
discussed following the example:
<p><br><pre>

    String
        a("Hello World\n"),             // see (1)
        b,                              // see (2)
        c = a;                          // see (3)

    int main()
    {
        b = c;                          // see (4)
        return (0);
    }

</pre>

<p><br><ul>
<p><br><li > Statement 1: this statement shows an initialization. 
    The object <code>a</code> is
    initialized with a string ``Hello World''. This construction of the object
    <code>a</code> therefore uses the constructor which expects one string argument.
<p><br>It should be noted here that this form is identical to
    <pre>
    
        String    
            a = "Hello World\n";    
    
</pre>
    
    Even though this piece of code uses the operator <code>=</code>, this is no
    assignment: rather, it is an <em>initialization</em>, and hence, it's
    done at <em>construction time</em> by a constructor of the class <code>String</code>.
<p><br><li > Statement 2: here a second <code>String</code> object is created. Again a
    constructor is called. As no special arguments are present, 
    the <em>default constructor</em> is used.
<p><br><li > Statement 3: again a new object <code>c</code> is created. A constructor
    is therefore called once more. 
    The new object is also initialized. This time with a copy of the data of
    object <code>a</code>.
<p><br>This form of initializations has not yet been discussed. As we can
    rewrite this statement in the form
    <pre>
    
        String    
            c(a);    
    
</pre>
    
    it suggests that a constructor is called, with as
    argument a (reference to a) <code>String</code> object. Such constructors are
    quite common in <strong>C++</strong> and are called <em>copy constructors</em>. More
    properties of these constructors are discussed below.
<p><br><li > Statement 4: here one object is assigned to another. No object is
    <em>created</em> in this statement. Hence, this is just an assignment, using
    the overloaded assignment operator.
<p><br></ul>
<p><br>The simple rule emanating from these examples is that 
<em>whenever an object is created, a constructor is needed</em>. 
All constructors have the following characteristics:
<p><br><ul>
    <li > Constructors have no return values.
<p><br><li > Constructors are defined in functions having the same names as the
    class to which they belong.
<p><br><li > The argument list of constructors can be deduced from the code.
    The argument is either present between parentheses or following a <code>=</code>.
<p><br></ul>
<p><br>Therefore, we conclude that, given the above statement (3), the class
<code>String</code> must be rewritten to define a <strong>copy constructor</strong>:
<p><br><pre>

    // class definition
    class String
    {
        public:
            ...
            String(String const &amp;other);
            ...
    };

    // constructor definition
    String::String(String const &amp;other)
    {
        str = strdupnew(other.str);
    }

</pre>

<p><br>The actions of copy constructors are comparable to those of the overloaded
assignment operators: an object is <em>duplicated</em>, so that it
contains its own allocated data. The copy constructor function, however, is
simpler in the following respect:
<p><br><ul>
<p><br><li > A copy constructor doesn't need to deallocate previously allocated
    memory: since the object in question has just been created, it cannot
    already have its own allocated data.
<p><br><li > A copy constructor never needs to check whether auto-duplication
    occurs. No variable can be initialized with itself.
<p><br></ul>
<p><br>Besides the above mentioned quite obvious usage of the copy constructor, the
copy
constructor has other important tasks. All of these tasks are related to the
fact that the copy constructor is always called when an object is created and
initialized with another object of its class.
The copy constructor is called even when this new object is a hidden 
or temporary variable.
<p><br><ul>
<p><br><li > When a function takes an object as argument, instead of, e.g., a
    pointer or a reference, <strong>C++</strong> calls the copy constructor to pass a copy
    of an object as the argument. This argument, which usually is passed via
    the stack, is therefore a new object. It is 
    created and initialized with the data of the passed argument.
<p><br>This is illustrated in the following code fragment:
    <pre>

        void func(String s)         // no pointer, no reference
        {                           // but the String itself
            puts(s.get());
        }

        int main()
        {
            String
                hi("hello world");

            func(hi);
            return (0);
        }
    
</pre>

    In this code fragment <code>hi</code> itself is not passed as an argument, but 
    instead a 
    temporary(stack) variable is created using the copy constructor. This
    temporary variable is known within <code>func()</code> as <code>s</code>. Note that if
    <code>func()</code> would have been defined using a reference argument, 
    extra stack usage and a
    call to the copy constructor would have been avoided.
<p><br><li > The copy constructor is also implicitly called when a function
    returns an object.
<p><br>This situation occurs when, e.g., a function returns keyboard input in a
    <code>String</code> format:
    <pre>

        String getline()
        {
            char
                buf [100];          // buffer for kbd input

            gets(buf);              // read buffer

            String
                ret = buf;          // convert to String

            return(ret);            // and return it
        }
    
</pre>

    A hidden <code>String</code> object is here initialized with the return value
    <code>ret</code> (using the copy constructor) and is returned by the function. The
    local variable <code>ret</code> itself ceases to exist when <code>getline()</code>
    terminates.
<p><br></ul>
<p><br>To demonstrate that copy constructors are not called in all situations,
consider the following.  We could rewrite the above function <code>getline()</code> to
the following form:
<pre>

    String getline()
    {
        char
            buf [100];          // buffer for kbd input

        gets(buf);              // read buffer
        return (buf);           // and return it
    }

</pre>

This code fragment is quite valid, even though the return value <code>char *</code>
doesn't match the prototype <code>String</code>. In this situation, <strong>C++</strong> will try
to convert the <code>char *</code> to a <code>String</code>. It can do that
given a
constructor expecting a <code>char *</code> argument.  This means that the copy
constructor is <em>not</em> used in this version of <code>getline()</code>. Instead, the
constructor expecting a <code>char *</code> argument is used.

<h3>5.4.1: Similarities between the copy constructor and operator=()</h3>
        <a name="alloc/copyopis"></a>
    The similarities between on one hand the copy constructor and on the other
hand the overloaded assignment operator are reinvestigated in this section.
We present here two primitive functions which often occur in our code, and
which we think are quite useful. Note the following features of copy 
constructors, overloaded assignment operators, and destructors:
<p><br><ul>
<p><br><li > The <em>duplication of (private) data</em> occurs (1) in
       the copy constructor and (2) in the overloaded assignment function.
<p><br><li > The <em>deallocation of used memory</em> occurs (1) in the 
    overloaded assignment function and (2) in the destructor.
<p><br></ul>
<p><br>The two above actions (duplication and deallocation) can be coded in two
private functions, say <code>copy()</code> and <code>destroy()</code>, which are used in the
overloaded assignment operator, the copy constructor, and the destructor. When
we apply this method to the class <code>Person</code>, we can rewrite the code as
follows.
<p><br>First, the class definition is expanded with two <code>private</code> functions
<code>copy()</code> and <code>destroy()</code>. The purpose of these functions is to
copy the data of another object or to deallocate the
memory of the current object <em>unconditionally</em>. 
Hence these functions implement `primitive' functionality:
<pre>

    // class definition, only relevant functions are shown here
    class Person
    {
        public:
            // constructors, destructor
            Person(Person const &amp;other);
            ~Person();

            // overloaded assignment
            Person const &amp;operator=(Person const &amp;other);
        private:
            // data fields
            char 
                *name, 
                *address, 
                *phone;

            // the two primitives
            void copy(Person const &amp;other);
            void destroy(void);
    };

</pre>

<p><br>Next, we present the implementations of the functions <code>copy()</code> and
<code>destroy()</code>:
<p><br><pre>

    // copy(): unconditionally copy other object's data
    void Person::copy(Person const &amp;other)
    {
        name = strdupnew(other.name);
        address = strdupnew(other.address);
        phone = strdupnew(other.phone);
    }

    // destroy(): unconditionally deallocate data
    void Person::destroy ()
    {
        delete name;
        delete address;
        delete phone;
    }

</pre>

<p><br>Finally the three <code>public</code> functions in which other object's memory is
copied or in which memory is deallocated are rewritten:
<p><br><pre>

    // copy constructor
    Person::Person (Person const &amp;other)
    {
        // unconditionally copy other's data
        copy(other);
    }

    // destructor
    Person::~Person()
    {
        // unconditionally deallocate
        destroy();
    }

    // overloaded assignment
    Person const &amp;Person::operator=(Person const &amp;other)
    {
        // only take action if no auto-assignment
        if (this != &amp;other)
        {
            destroy();
            copy(other);
        }
        // return (reference to) current object for
        // chain-assignments
        return (*this);
    }

</pre>

<p><br>What we like about this approach is that the destructor, copy constructor and
overloaded assignment functions are completely standard: they are independent
of a particular class, and <em>their implementations 
can therefore be used in every class</em>. 
Any class dependencies are reduced to the implementations of the private 
member functions <code>copy()</code> and <code>destroy()</code>.

<h2>5.5: Conclusion</h2>
    <a name="alloc/conclusion"></a>
    Two important extensions to classes have been discussed in this chapter: the
overloaded assignment operator and the copy constructor. As we have seen,
classes with pointer data which address allocated memory are potential sources
of semantic errors. The two introduced extensions represent 
the standard ways to prevent unintentional loss of allocated data.
<p><br>The conclusion is therefore: as soon as a class is defined in which pointer
data-members are used, a destructor, an overloaded assignment function and a
copy constructor should be implemented.
