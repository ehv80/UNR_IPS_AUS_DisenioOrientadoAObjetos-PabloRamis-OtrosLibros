    In the previous chapters we have shown examples of classes where each object
of a class had its own set of <code>public</code> or <code>private</code> data. Each
<code>public</code> or <code>private</code> function could access the object's own
version of the data.
<p><br>In some situations it may be desirable that one or more <em>common</em> data
fields exist, which are accessible to <em>all</em> objects of the class. An
example of such a situation is the name of the startup directory in a program
which recursively scans the directory tree of a disk. A second example is a
flag variable, which states whether some specific initialization has occurred:
only the first object of the class would then perform the initialization and
would then set the flag to `done'.
<p><br>Such situations are analogous to <strong>C</strong> code, where several functions need to
access the same variable. A common solution in <strong>C</strong> is to define all these
functions in one source file and to declare the variable as a <code>static</code>:
the variable name is then not known beyond the scope of the source file. This
approach is quite valid, but doesn't stroke with our philosophy of one
function per source file. Another <strong>C</strong>-solution is to give the variable in
question an unusual name, e.g., <code>_6uldv8</code>, and then to hope that
other program parts won't use this name by accident. Neither the first, nor
the second <strong>C</strong>-like solution is elegant.
<p><br><strong>C++</strong>'s solution is to define <code>static</code> data and functions, 
common to all objects of a class, and inaccessible outside of the class. 
These functions and data will be discussed in this
chapter.

<h2>8.1: Static data</h2>
    <a name="static/data"></a>
    A data member of a class can be declared <code>static</code>; be it in the <code>public</code>
or <code>private</code> part of the class definition. Such a data member is created
and initialized only once, in contrast to non-static data members, which are
created again and again, for each separate object of the class. 
A <code>static</code> data member is created once:
when the program starts executing. Nonetheless, it is still part of the class.
<p><br><code>static</code> data members which are declared <code>public</code> are like `normal'
global variables: they can be reached by <em>all code of the program</em> using
their name, together with their class name and the scope resolution operator.
This is illustrated in the following code fragment:
<pre>

    class Test
    {
        public:
            static int
                public_int;
        private:
            static int
                private_int;
    }

    int main()
    {
        Test::public_int = 145;     // ok    

        Test::private_int = 12;     // wrong, don't touch    
                                    // the private parts    
        return (0);
    }

</pre>

This code fragment is not suitable for consumption by a <strong>C++</strong> compiler: it
only illustrates the <em>interface</em>, and not the <em>implementation</em> of
<code>static</code> data members. We will discuss the implementation of such members
shortly.

<p><br><a name="l121"></a>
<h3>8.1.1: Private static data</h3>
        <a name="static/private"></a>
    To illustrate the use of a <code>static</code> data member which is a <code>private</code>
variable in a class, consider the following code fragment:
<p><br><pre>

    class Directory
    {
        public:
            // constructors, destructors, etc. (not shown)
            ...
        private:
            // data members
            static char 
                path[];
    };

</pre>

<p><br>The data member <code>path[]</code> is a <code>private static</code> variable. During the 
execution of the program, only <em>one</em> <code>Directory::path[]</code> exists,
even though more than one object of the class <code>Directory</code> may
exist. This data member could be inspected or altered by the constructor,
destructor or by any other member function of the class <code>Directory</code>.
<p><br>Since constructors are called for each new object of a class, <code>static</code> data
members are never <em>initialized</em> by constructors. At most they are
<em>modified</em>. The reason for this is that the <code>static</code> data members exist
<em>before</em> the constructor of the class is called for the very first time.
The <code>static</code> data members can be initialized during their
definition, outside of all member functions, in the same way as global
variables are initialized. The definition and initialization of a <code>static</code>
data member usually occurs in one of the source files of the class functions,
preferably in a source file dedicated to the definition of static data
members, called <code>data.cc</code>.
<p><br>The data member <code>path[]</code> from the above class <code>Directory</code> could thus be
defined and initialized in the source file of the constructor (or in a
separate file <code>data.cc</code>):
<p><br><pre>

    // the static data member: definition and initialization
    char
        Directory::path [200] = "/usr/local";

    // the default constructor
    Directory::Directory()
    {
        ...
    }

</pre>

<p><br>It should be noted that the definition of the <code>static</code> data member can
occur in <em>any</em> source file; as long as it is defined only once. So, there
is no need to define it in, e.g., a source file in which also a 
memberfunction of the class is implemented.
<p><br>In the class interface the <code>static</code> member is actually 
only <em>declared</em>. At its implementation (definition) 
its type and class name are explicitly stated. Note also that
the size specification can be left out of the interface, as is shown in
the above array <code>path[]</code>. However, its size <em>is</em> needed at its 
implementation.
<p><br>A second example of a useful <code>private static</code> data member is given
below. A class <code>Graphics</code> defines the communication of a program with a
graphics-capable device (e.g., a VGA screen). The initial preparing of the
device, which in this case would be to switch from text mode to graphics
mode, is an action of the constructor and depends on a <code>static</code> flag
variable <code>nobjects</code>. The variable <code>nobjects</code> simply counts the number of
<code>Graphics</code> objects which are present at one time. Similarly, the
destructor of the class may switch back from graphics mode to text mode when
the last <code>Graphics</code> object ceases to exist.
<p><br>The class interface for this <code>Graphics</code> class might be:
<pre>

    class Graphics
    {
        public:
            // constructor, destructor
            Graphics();
            ~Graphics();

            // other interface is not shown here,
            // e.g. to draw lines or whatever

        private:
            // counter of # of objects
            static int nobjects;

            // hypothetical functions to switch to graphics
            // mode or back to text mode
            void setgraphicsmode();
            void settextmode();
    }

</pre>

The purpose of the variable <code>nobjects</code> is to count the number of objects
which exist at one given time. When the first object is created, the graphics
device is initialized. At the destruction of the last <code>Graphics</code> 
object, the switch from graphics mode to text mode is made:
<pre>

    // the static data member
    int Graphics::nobjects = 0;

    // the constructor
    Graphics::Graphics()
    {
        if (! nobjects)
            setgraphicsmode();
        nobjects++;
    }

    // the destructor
    Graphics::~Graphics()
    {
        nobjects--;
        if (! nobjects)
            settextmode();
    }

</pre>

<p><br>It is obvious that when the class <code>Graphics</code> would define more than
one constructor, each constructor would need to increase the variable
<code>nobjects</code> and possibly would have to initialize the graphics mode.

<h3>8.1.2: Public static data</h3>
        <a name="static/public"></a>
    Data members can be declared in the <code>public</code> section of a class definition,
although this is not common practice (such a setup would violate the principle
of data hiding). E.g., when the <code>static</code> data member <code>path[]</code> from
chapter <a href="cplusplus08.html#StaticData">8.1</a> would be declared in the <code>public</code> section of
the class definition, all program code could access this variable:
<pre>

    int main()
    {
        getcwd(Directory::path, 199);
        return(0);
    }

</pre>

Note that the variable <code>path</code> would still have to be defined. As before,
the class interface would only <em>declare</em> the array <code>path[]</code>.
This means that some source file would still need to contain the 
implementation: 
<pre>

    char
        Directory::path[200];

</pre>


<p><br><a name="l123"></a>
<h2>8.2: Static member functions</h2>
    <a name="static/function"></a>
    Besides <code>static</code> data, <strong>C++</strong> allows the definition of <code>static</code>
functions. Similar to the concept of <code>static</code> data, in which these
variables are shared by all objects of the class, <code>static</code> functions apply
to all objects of the class.
<p><br>The <code>static</code> functions can therefore address only the <code>static</code> data of a
class; non-<code>static</code> data are unavailable to these functions. If
non-<code>static</code> data could be addressed, to which object would they belong?
Similarly, <code>static</code> functions cannot call non-<code>static</code> functions of the
class. All this is caused by the fact that <code>static</code> functions have no
<code>this</code> pointer.
<p><br>Functions which are <code>static</code> and which are declared in the <code>public</code> section
of a class interface can be called without specifying an object of the class.
This is illustrated in the following code fragment:
<p><br><pre>

    class Directory
    {
        public:
            // constructors, destructors etc. not shown here
            ...
            // here's the static public function
            static void setpath(char const *newpath);

        private:
            // the static string
            static char path [];
    };

    // implementation of the static variable
    char Directory::path [199] = "/usr/local";

    // the static function
    void Directory::setpath(char const *newpath)
    {
        strncpy(path, newpath, 199);
    }

    // example of the usage
    int main()
    {
        // Alternative (1): calling setpath() without
        // an object of the class Directory
        Directory::setpath("/etc");

        // Alternative (2): with an object
        Directory
            dir;

        dir.setpath("/etc");

        return (0);
    } 
 
</pre>
 
 In the example above the function <code>setpath()</code> is a <code>public static</code>
function.  <strong>C++</strong> also allows <code>private static</code> functions: these functions
can only be called from other member functions of the class of which they are
themselves members, but not from other functions.
<p><br>Note that such a <code>private static</code> function could only
(a) access static variables, or (b) call other static functions: non-static
code or data members would still be inaccessible to the static function.
