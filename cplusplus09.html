Pointers in classes have been discussed in detail in chapter <a href="cplusplus05.html#Person">5.1</a>.
As we have seen, when pointer data-members occur in classes, such  classes 
deserve some special treatment.
<p><br>By now it is well known how to treat pointer data members: constructors are
used to initialize pointers, destructors are needed to free the memory
pointed to by the pointer data members. 
<p><br>Furthermore, in classes having pointer data members
copy constructors and overloaded assignment operators are normally needed as 
well. 
<p><br>However, in some situations we do not need a pointer to an object, 
but rather a pointer to members of an object. The realization of pointers to
<em>members</em> of an object is the subject of this part of the <strong>C++</strong> 
annotations. 
<p><br> 
<p><br><a name="l125"></a>
<h2>9.1: Pointers to members: an example</h2>
    <a name="ptrmembers/example"></a>
    
Knowing how pointers to variables and objects are to be used does not
intuitively lead to the concept of pointer to <em>members</em>. Even if the 
returntype and parametertypes of a memberfunction are taken 
into account, surprises are encountered. 
For example, consider the following class:
<p><br><pre>

    class String
    { 
        public:
            ...
            char const *get() const;
        private:
            ...
            char const *(*sp)() const;
    };

</pre>

Within this class, it is not possible to define a <code>char const *(*sp)() const</code>
pointing to the <code>get()</code> member function of the <code>String</code> 
class. 
<p><br>One of the reasons why this doesn't work is that the variable <code>sp</code>
has a global scope, while the memberfunction <code>get()</code> is defined
within the <code>String</code> class. The fact that the variable <code>sp</code> is part of
the <code>String</code> class is of no relevance. According to <code>sp</code>'s definition,
it points to a function outside of the class.
<p><br>Consequently, in order to define a 
pointer to a member (either data or function, but usually a function) of a 
class, the scope of the pointer must be within the class' scope. 
Doing so, a pointer to a member of the class <code>String</code> can be defined as
<pre>

    char const
        *(String::*sp)() const;

</pre>

So, due to the <code>String::</code> prefix, <code>sp</code> is defined to be active 
only in the context of the class <code>String</code>. In this context, it is 
defined as a pointer to a const function, not expecting arguments, and 
returning a pointer to const chars.
<p><br>
<p><br><a name="l126"></a>
<h2>9.2: Initializing pointers to members</h2>
    <a name="ptrmembers/initialize"></a>
    
Pointers to members can be initialized to point to intended members. Such a 
pointer can be defined either inside or outside a member function. 
<p><br>Initializing or assigning an address to such a pointer does nothing but 
indicating which member the pointer will point to. However, member functions 
(except for the static member functions) can only be used when associated with 
an object of the member function's class. The same holds true for pointers to
data members. 
<p><br>While it is allowed to <em>initialize</em> such a pointer outside of the class,
it is not possible to <em>access</em> such a function 
without an associated object. 
<p><br>In the following example these characteristics 
are illustrated. First, a pointer is initialized to point to
the function <code>String::get()</code>. In this case <em>no</em> <code>String</code> object is 
required.
<p><br>Next, a <code>String</code> object is defined, and the string that is stored within the 
object is retrieved through the pointer, and not directly by the function
<code>String::get()</code>. Note that the pointer is a 
variable existing outside of the class' context. 
This presents no problem, as the actual 
object to be used is identified by the statement in which object and 
pointervariable are combined. Consider the following piece of code:
<pre>

    void fun()
    {
        char const
            *(String::*sp)() const;
            
        sp = String::get;   // assign the address
                            // of String's get()
                            // function
                   
        String              // define a String object
            s("Hello world");

        cout &lt;&lt; (s.*sp)()   // show the string
             &lt;&lt; endl;

        String
            *ps;            // pointer to a String object

        ps = &amp;s;            // initialize ps to point at s

        cout &lt;&lt; (ps-&gt;*sp)() // show the string again
             &lt;&lt; endl;
    }

</pre>

Note in this example the statement <code>(s.*sp)()</code>. The <code>.*</code> construction 
indicates that <code>sp</code> is a pointer to a member function. Since the 
pointer variable <code>sp</code> points to the <code>String::get()</code> function,
this function is now called, producing the string <code>``hello world''</code>.
<p><br>Furthermore, note the parentheses around <code>(s.*sp)</code>. These parentheses are
required. If they were omitted, then the default interpretation (now 
parenthesized for further emphasis) would be <code>s.* (sp())</code>. 
This latter construction means
<ul>  
    <li > Call function <code>sp()</code>, which should return a pointer to a 
        member. E.g., <code>sp()</code> has the prototype 
        <center><code>char const * (String::*)() sp();</code> </center>
            So, <code>sp()</code> is a 
        function returning a pointer to a memberfunction of the class 
        <code>String</code>, while such a memberfunction must return a pointer to 
        <code>const char</code>s.
    <li > Apply this pointer with regard to object s.
</ul>
Not an impossible or unlikely construction, but wrong as far as the current 
definition of <code>sp</code> is concerned.
<p><br>When a pointer to a member function is associated with an object, the pointer
to member selector operator <code>.*</code> is used. When a pointer to an object 
is used (instead of  the object itself) the ``pointer to member through a 
pointer to a class object'' operator <code>-&gt;*</code> operator is required. The 
use of this operator is also illustrated in the above example.
<p><br>
<p><br><a name="l127"></a>
<h2>9.3: Pointers to static members</h2>
    <a name="ptrmembers/static"></a>
    
Static members of a class exist without an object of their class. In other 
words, they can exist <em>outside of</em> any object of their class.
<p><br>When these static members are public, they can be accessed in a `stand-alone' 
fashion.
<p><br>Assume that the <code>String</code> class also has a public static member function
<code>int n_strings()</code>, returning the number of string objects created so 
far. Then, without using any <code>String</code> object the function 
<code>String::n_strings()</code> may be called:
<pre>

    void fun()
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; String::n_strings() &lt;&lt; endl;
    }

</pre>

Since pointers to members are always associated with an object, the use 
of a pointer to a memberfunction would normally produce an error. 
However, <em>static</em> members are
actually <em>global variables or functions</em>, bound to their class. 
<p><br>Public 
static members can be treated as globally accessible functions and data. 
Private static members, on the other hand, can be accessed only from within 
the context of their class: they can only be accessed from inside the member 
functions of their class.
<p><br>Since static members have no particular link with objects of their 
class, but look a lot like global functions, a pointer variable that is <em>not</em>
part of the class of the member function  must be used.
<p><br>Consequently, a variable <code>int (*pfi)()</code> can be used to point to the 
static memberfunction <code>int String::n_strings()</code>, even though <code>int (*pfi)()</code>
has <em>nothing</em> in common with the <code>class String</code>. This is illustrated in 
the next example:
<pre>

    void fun()
    {
        int 
            (*pfi)();
            
        pfi = String::n_strings;    
                    // address of the  static memberfunction

        cout &lt;&lt; pfi() &lt;&lt; endl;
                    // print the value produced by
                    // String::n_strings()
    }

</pre>

<h2>9.4: Using pointers to members for real</h2>
    <a name="ptrmembers/real"></a>
    
Let's assume that a database is created in which information about  persons 
is stored. Name, street names, city names, house numbers, birthdays, etc. are 
collected in objects of the class <code>Person</code>, which are, in turn, stored 
in a class <code>Person_dbase</code>. Partial interfaces of these classes could be 
designed as follows:
<pre>

    class Date;

    class Person()
    {
        public:
            ...
            char const *get_name() const;   
            Date const &amp;birthdate() const;
        private:
            ...
    };

    class Person_dbase
    {
        public:  
            enum Listtype
            {
                list_by_name,
                list_by_birthday,
            };
            void list(Listtype type);
        private:
            Person
                *pp;    // pointer to the info
            unsigned
                n;      // number of persons stored.
    };

</pre>

The organization of <code>Person</code> and <code>Person_dbase</code> is pictured in 
figure <a href="cplusplus09.html#PersonFig">10</a>: Within a <code>Person_dbase</code> object the <code>Person</code> objects
are stored. They can be reached via the pointer variable <code>Person *pp</code>.
    <a name="PersonFig"></a><p><center><img src="images/personfig.gif" align="bottom" alt="figure 10 is shown here."><br> 
figure 10: Person_dbase objects: Persons reached via Person *pp 
</center><p><br>
    
<p><br>We would like to develop the function <code>Person_dbase::list()</code> in such a 
way that it lists the contents of the database sorted according to a selected
field of a <code>Person</code> object. 
<p><br>So, when <code>list()</code> is called to list the 
database sorted by <em>names</em>, the database of <code>Person</code> objects is first 
sorted by names, and is then listed.
<p><br>Alternatively, when <code>list()</code> is called to list the 
database sorted by <em>birthdates</em>, the database of <code>Person</code> objects 
is first sorted by birthdates, and is then listed.
<p><br>In this situation, the function <code>qsort()</code> is most likely called to do 
the actual sorting of the <code>Person</code> objects (
In the current implementation <code>pp</code> points to an array of <code>Person</code>
objects. In this implementation, the function <code>qsort()</code> will have to 
copy the actual <code>Person</code> objects again and again, which may be rather
inefficient when the <code>Person</code> objects become large. Under an alternative
implementation, in which the <code>Person</code> objects are reached through 
pointers, the efficiency of the <code>qsort()</code> function will be improved. In that 
case, the datamember <code>pp</code> will have to be declared as 
<code>Person **pp</code>.).
This function requires a pointer to a compare function, comparing
two elements of the array to be sorted. The prototype of this compare function 
is 
    <center><code>int (*)(void const *, void const *)</code> </center>
However, when used with 
<code>Person</code> objects, the prototype of the <code>compare()</code> function should be
    <center><code>int (*)(Person const *, Person const *)</code> </center>
Somewhere a typecast
will be required: either when calling <code>qsort()</code>, or within the <code>
compare()</code> functions themselves. We will use the typecast when calling
<code>qsort()</code>, using the following typedef to reduce the verbosity of the 
typecasts
(a <em>pointer to an integer function requiring two void pointers</em>):
    <center><code>typedef int (*pif2vp)(void const *, void const *)</code> </center>
<p><br>Next, the function <code>list()</code> could be developed according to the following 
setup: 
<pre>

    void Person_dbase::list(Listtype type)
    {
        switch (type)
        {
            case list_by_name:
                qsort(pp, n, sizeof(Person), (pif2vp)cmpname);
            break;

            case list_by_birthday:
                qsort(pp, n, sizeof(Person), (pif2vp)cmpdate);
            break;
        }
        // list the sorted Person-database
    }

</pre>

There are several reasons why this setup is not particularly desirable:
<p><br><ul>  
    <li > Although the example only shows two list-alternatives (sort by name 
        and sort by birthday), a real-life implementation will have many more
        ways to list the information. This will soon result in a very long
        function <code>list()</code> which will be hard to maintain and will
        look inaccessible due to its length. 
    <li > Every time a new way to list the data in the database, the function
        <code>list()</code> will have to be expanded, by offering an extra 
        <code>case</code> label for every new way to list the data.
    <li > Much of the code in the function <code>list()</code> will be repeated 
        within the function, showing only some small differences.
</ul>
<p><br>Much of the complexity of <code>list()</code> function could be reduced by 
defining <em>pointers</em> to the compare-functions, storing these pointers in an 
array. Since this array will be common to all <code>Person_dbase</code> objects, 
it should be defined as a static array, containing the pointers to the 
compare-functions.
<p><br>Before actually constructing this array, note that this approach requires the
definition of as many compare functions as there are elements in the 
<code>Listtype</code> enum. So, to list the information sorted by name a function
<code>cmpname()</code> is used, comparing the names stored in two 
<code>Person</code> objects, while a function <code>cmpcity()</code>, is used to compare
cities. Somehow this seems to be redundant as well: we would like to use
one function to compare strings, whatever their meanings. Comparable 
considerations hold true for other fields of information.
<p><br>The compare functions, however, receive pointers to <code>Person</code>
objects. Therefore, the data-members of the <code>Person</code> objects to which
these pointers point can be accessed using the access-memberfunctions
of the <code>Person</code> class. So, the compare functions can access these
data-members as well, using the pointers to the <code>Person</code> objects.
<p><br>Now note that the access memberfunctions that are used within a particular
compare function can be <em>hard-coded</em>, by plainly mentioning the accessors
to be used, and they can be selected indirectly, by using <em>pointers</em>
to the accessors to be used. 
<p><br>This latter solution allows us to <em>merge</em> compare functions that 
use the same implementations, but use different accessors: By setting a pointer
to the appropriate accessor function just before the compare function is
called, one single compare function can be used to compare many different
kinds of data stored inside <code>Person</code> objects.
<p><br>The compare functions themselves are used within the context of the 
<code>Person_dbase</code> class, where they are passed to the <code>qsort()</code> function. The 
<code>qsort()</code> function, however, is a global function. Consequently, the compare 
functions can't be ordinary member functions of the class <code>Person_dbase</code>, 
but they must be static members of that class, so they  can be passed to the 
<code>qsort()</code> function.
<p><br>Summarizing what we've got so far, we see that the problem has been
broken down as follows:
<ul>  
    <li > The <code>switch</code> construction in the <code>list()</code> function
        should be replaced by a call to a function using a pointer to 
        a function. 
    <li > The actual function to be used is determined by the 
        value of the selector, which is given to <code>list()</code> when it's
        called.
    <li > The <code>compare()</code> functions may be further 
        abstracted by combining those comparing the same types. 
    <li > When <code>compare()</code> functions are combined, the access
        memberfunction of the <code>Person</code> objects to be used will also
        be found via an array containing pointers to the access member 
        functions of <code>Person</code> objects.
    <li > The <code>compare()</code> functions are part of the <code>
        Person_dbase</code> class, but it must also be possible to 
        give their addresses as arguments to <code>qsort()</code>. Hence, these
        functions must be defined as static functions of the class 
        <code>Person_dbase</code>.
</ul>
<p><br>From this analysis the essential characteristics of the proposed implementation
emerge. 
<p><br>For every type of listing, as produced by the function <code>list()</code>, the 
following is required:
<p><br><ul>  
    <li > The access member function of the <code>Person</code> class to be
        used.
    <li > The <code>compare()</code> function to be used. The <code>compare()</code> functions
        will be <em>static functions</em> of the class <code>Person_dbase</code>, so that
        they can be passed over to <code>qsort()</code>
</ul>
<p><br>This information does not depend on a particular <code>Person_dbase</code> object, 
but is common to all of these objects. Hence it will be stored compile-time
in a <code>static Person_dbase</code> kind of array. 
<p><br>How will the <code>compare()</code> functions know which element of this array to
use? The requested index is passed to the <code>list()</code> member function
as a <code>Listtype</code> value. The <code>list()</code> function can then save this
information in a <code>static Person_dbase::Listtype</code> variable for the
<code>compare()</code> functions to use.
<p><br>We've analyzed enough. Let's build it this way.
<p><br>
<p><br><a name="l129"></a>
<h3>9.4.1: Pointers to members: an implementation</h3>
        <a name="ptrmembers/implement"></a>
    <ul>  
<p><br><li > First, the necessary class interfaces are defined. The existence
        of a class <code>Date</code> is assumed, containing overloaded operators
        like <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> to compare dates. 
        To start with, we present the interface of the class
        <code>Person</code>, omitting all the standard stuff like overloaded assignment 
        operator, (copy) constructors, etc.:
<pre>

    #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;     // for qsort()

    class Date;

    class Person()
    {
        public:
            unsigned length() const;
            unsigned weight() const;
            char const *name() const;   
            char const *city() const;
            Date const &amp;birthdate() const;

        private:
            // all necessary data members
    };

</pre>

<p><br><li > Next, the class <code>Person_dbase</code>.
        Within this class a <code>struct CmpPerson</code> is defined, containing
        two fields:
        <ul>  
<p><br><li > A pointer to a union of compare functions. 
<p><br>As the compare functions
                are static functions of the class <code>Person_dbase</code>,
                pointers to these functions are indiscernible from pointers to
                functions at the global (<code>::</code>) level. The compare functions
                return <code>int</code>s (for <code>qsort()</code>), and expect two
                pointers to <code>Person const</code> objects. The field
                <code>persons</code> expects the two pointers to 
                <code>Person const</code> objects. The field <code>voids</code>
                is the alternate interpretation, to be used with 
                <code>qsort()</code>, instead of the typecast <code>(pif2vp)</code>.
<p><br><li > A field <code>pf</code> (pointer to access function) of
                the nested <code>union Person_accessor</code>. 
<p><br>The types of as many different
                access functions of the <code>Person</code> class as are used in 
                the class are declared in this union. 
<p><br>Access functions returning <code>int</code>s, <code>char const *</code>s and
                <code>Date &amp;</code>s will be needed. Consequently, the 
                <code>Person_accessor</code> union contains these (three) types.
<p><br></ul>
<p><br>From this <code>CmpPerson</code> struct a static array 
        <code>cmpPerson[]</code> is constructed. It is a 
        <code>static Person_dbase</code> array, making it possible for the 
        compare functions to inspect its elements (
        The number of elements of the <code>cmpPerson[]</code> array is not specified
        in the interface: that number is determined compile-time by the 
        compiler, when the static variable <code>cmpPerson[]</code> is initialized.).
<p><br>Also note the <code>static Listtype selector</code>. This variable
        will be used later in the compare functions to find the actual
        <code>Person</code> access function to be used.
        Here, then, is the interface of the class <code>Person_dbase</code>:
<pre>

    class Person_dbase
    {
        public:  
            enum Listtype
            {
                list_by_length,
                list_by_weight,
                list_by_name,            
                list_by_city,
                list_by_birthday,
            };

            // ... constructors etc.

            void list(Listtype type);
                        // list the information
        private:
            struct CmpPerson
            {                                                     
                union Compare_function

<p><br>Next, we define each of the members of the <code>Person_dbase</code> class
    (as far as necessary).
<p><br><li > The <code>list()</code> function now only has to do three things:
        <ul>  
            <li > The <code>Listtype</code> parameter is copied to
                <code>selector</code>,
            <li > The function <code>qsort()</code> is called. Note the
                use of the <code>cmpPerson</code> array to determine which compare
                function to use.
            <li > The information of the <code>Person</code>objects is
                displayed. This part is left for the reader to implement.
        </ul>
<p><br><pre>

    void Person_dbase::list(Listtype type)
    {
        selector = type;
        qsort(pp, n, sizeof(Person), cmpPerson[type].cmp.voids);
        // list the sorted Person-database (to be implemented)
    }

</pre>

<p><br><li > The array <code>cmpPerson[]</code> is a static array of <code>CmpPerson</code>
        elements. In this example there are five different ways to sort
        the data. Consequently, there are five elements in the array
        <code>cmpPerson[]</code>. All these elements can be defined and initialized
        by the compiler. No run-time execution time is needed for this.
<p><br>However, note the form of the declaration: the array is defined in
        the scope of the <code>Person_dbase</code> class. Its elements are 
        <code>CmpPerson</code>s, also defined in the scope of the <code>Person_dbase</code>
        class. Hence the double mentioning of <code>Person_dbase</code>.
<pre>

    Person_dbase::CmpPerson
        Person_dbase::cmpPerson[] = 
        {
            {       // compare- and access
                    // function to compare length
                cmpint,
                Person::length,
            },

            {       // same for weight
                cmpint,
                Person::weight,
            },

            {       // same for name
                cmpstr,
                Person::name,
            },

            {       // same for city
                cmpstr,
                Person::city,
            },

            {       // same for Date
                cmpdate,
                Person::birthdate,
            },
        };

</pre>

<p><br><li > Now only the compare functions remain to be implemented. Although
        five accessors can be used, only three compare functions are needed.
<p><br>The compare functions, being static functions, have access to the 
        <code>cmpPerson[]</code> array and to the <code>Listtype selector</code> variable. This 
        information is used by the compare functions to call the relevant 
        access member function 
        of the two <code>Person</code> objects, pointed to by the parameters of the
        compare functions. 
<p><br>For this, the <code>pointer to member</code> operator
        <code>-&gt;*</code> is used. The element <code>cmpPerson[selector]</code>
        contains the function pointers to the functions to be used: 
        they are the fields
        <code>pf</code>, variant <code>cp, i</code> or <code>d</code>. These fields
        return a pointer to a particular access function of a <code>Person</code>
        object. 
<p><br>Through these pointers the functions can be associated to a 
        particular <code>Person</code>
        object using the pointer to member operator. This results in 
        expressions like:
        <center><code>p1-&gt;*cmpPerson[selector].pf.cp</code> </center> 
<p><br>By this time we have
        the name (i.e., address) of an access function for a particular 
        <code>Person</code> object. To call this function, parentheses are needed,
        one set of parentheses to protect this expression from 
        desintegrating due to the 
        high priority of the second set of parentheses, which are 
        needed for the actual call of the function. Hence, we get:
        <center><code>(p1-&gt;*cmpPerson[selector].pf.cp)()</code> </center>
<p><br>Finally, here are the three compare functions:
<pre>

    int Person_dbase::cmpstr(Person const *p1, Person const *p2)
    {
        return 
        (
            strcmp
            (         
                (p1-&gt;*cmpPerson[selector].pf.cp)(),
                (p2-&gt;*cmpPerson[selector].pf.cp)()
            )
        );
    }

    int Person_dbase::cmpint(Person const *p1, Person const *p2)
    {
        return 
        (
            (p1-&gt;*cmpPerson[selector].pf.i)() 
            - 
            (p2-&gt;*cmpPerson[selector].pf.i)()
        );
    }

    int Person_dbase::cmpdate(Person const *p1, Person const *p2)
    {
        return 
        (
            (p1-&gt;*cmpPerson[selector].pf.d)() 
            &lt; 
            (p2-&gt;*cmpPerson[selector].pf.d)() ?    
                -1    
            :    
                (p1-&gt;*cmpPerson[selector].pf.d)() 
                &gt; 
                (p2-&gt;*cmpPerson[selector].pf.d)()     
        );
    }
