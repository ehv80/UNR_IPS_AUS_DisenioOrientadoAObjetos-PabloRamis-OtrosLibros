    In <strong>C</strong> there are several ways to have a program react to situations which
break the normal unhampered flow of the program: 
<ul>
    <li > The function may notice the abnormality and issue a message. This is
probably the least disastrous reaction a program may show.
    <li > The function in which the abnormality is observed may decide to stop
its intended task, returning an errorcode to its caller. This is a great
example of postponing decisions: now the calling function is faced with a
problem. Of course the calling function may act similarly, by passing the
error-code up to <em>its</em> caller.
    <li > The function may decide that things are going out of hand, and may
call <code>exit()</code> to terminate the program completely. A tough way to handle a
problem. 
    <li > The function may use a combination of the functions <code>setjmp()</code> and
longjmp()) to enforce non-local exits. This mechanism implements a kind of
<code>goto</code> jump, allowing the program to proceed at an outer section, skipping
the intermediate levels which would have to be visited if a series of
returns from nested functions would have been used.
</ul>
<p><br>In <strong>C++</strong> all the above ways to handle flow-breaking situations are still
available. However, the last way, using <code>setjmp()</code> and <code>longjmp()</code> isn't
often seen in <strong>C++</strong> (or even in <strong>C</strong>) programs, due to the fact that the
program flow is completely disrupted.
<p><br>In <strong>C++</strong> the alternative to using <code>setjmp()</code> and <code>longjmp()</code> are
<em>exceptions</em>. Exceptions are a mechanism by which a controlled non-local
exit is realized within the context of a <strong>C++</strong> program, without the
disadvantages of <code>longjmp()</code> and <code>setjmp()</code>.
<p><br>Exceptions are the proper way to bail out of a situation which cannot be
handled easily by a function itself, but which are not disastrous enough for
the program to terminate completely. Also, exceptions provide a flexible layer
of flow control between the short-range <code>return</code> and the crude <code>exit()</code>.
<p><br>In this chapter the use of exceptions and their syntax will be
discussed. First an example of the different impacts exceptions and
<code>setjmp()</code> and <code>longjmp()</code> have on the  program will be given. Then
the discussion will dig into the formalities of the use of exceptions.

<h2>12.1: Using exceptions: an outline</h2>
    <a name="exceptions/outline"></a>
    Using exceptions, it involves the following syntactical elements:
<ul>
    <li ><code>try</code>. The <code>try</code>-block surrounds statements in which exceptions may
be generated (the parlance is for exceptions to be  thrown). Example:
<pre>

    try
    {
        // statements in which
        // exceptions may be thrown
    }

</pre>

    <li ><code>throw</code>: followed by an expression of a certain type, throws the
expressionvalue as an exception. The <code>throw</code> statement should be executed
somewhere within the <code>try</code>-block: either directly or from within a function
called directly or indirectly from the <code>try</code>-block. Example:
<pre>

    throw "This generates a char * exception";

</pre>

    <li ><code>catch</code>: Immediately following the <code>try</code>-block, the <code>catch</code>-block
receives the thrown exceptions. Example of a <code>catch</code>-block receiving 
<code>char *</code> exceptions:
<pre>

    catch (char *message)
    {
        // statements in which
        // the thrown char * exceptions 
        // are processed
    }

</pre>

</ul>

<h3>12.1.1: Compiling sources in which exceptions are used</h3>
        <a name="exceptions/compiling"></a>
    The <code>Gnu g++</code> compiler requires a special flag to compile sources in which
exceptions are used. It is quite possible that other compilers require similar
flags, but that hasn't been investigated by us. 
<p><br>If the keywords <code>throw, try</code> or <code>catch</code> are used in a sourcetext, or if a
sourcefile contains a function calling another function which may throw an 
exception the 
    <center><code>-fhandle-exceptions</code> </center>
must be used when these sources are compiled. 
<p><br>The easy way-out would of course be to include the <code>-fhandle-exceptions</code> all
the time, but it appears as though this doesn't always work properly,
sometimes resulting in linker-problems. 
<p><br>Fortunately it is usually well known whether a function may throw exceptions,
either directly or indirectly, and so the need for the 
    <center><code>-fhandle-exceptions</code> </center> 
flag is also usually well known.

<h2>12.2: An example using exceptions</h2>
    <a name="exceptions/example"></a>
    In the next two sections the same basic program will be used. The program uses
two classes, <code>Outer</code> and <code>Inner</code>. An <code>Outer</code> object is created in the
<code>main()</code> function, and the function <code>Outer::fun()</code> is called. 
Then, in the <code>Outer::fun()</code> function an <code>Inner</code> object is 
allocated. After allocating the <code>Inner</code> object, its memberfunction <code>fun()</code>
is called.
<p><br>That's about it. The function <code>Outer::fun()</code> terminates, and the destructor
of the <code>Inner</code> object is called. Then the program terminates and the 
destructor of the <code>Outer</code> object is called.
<p><br>Here is the basic program:
<p><br><pre>
#include &lt;iostream.h&gt;

class Inner
{
    public:
        Inner();
        ~Inner();
        void fun();    
};

class Outer
{
    public:
        Outer();
        ~Outer();
        void fun();
    private:
};

Inner::Inner()
{
    cout &lt;&lt; "Inner constructor\n";
}    

Inner::~Inner()
{
    cout &lt;&lt; "Inner destructor\n";
}    

void Inner::fun()
{
    cout &lt;&lt; "Inner fun\n";
}    

Outer::Outer()
{
    cout &lt;&lt; "Outer constructor\n";
}    

Outer::~Outer()
{
    cout &lt;&lt; "Outer destructor\n";
}    

void Outer::fun()
{
    Inner
        in;

    cout &lt;&lt; "Outer fun\n";
    in.fun();
}    

int main()
{
    Outer
        out;

    out.fun();
}





</pre>

<p><br>This program can be compiled and run, producing the following output:
<pre>

    Outer constructor
    Inner constructor
    Outer fun
    Inner fun
    Inner destructor
    Outer destructor

</pre>

This output is completely as expected, and it is exactly what we want: the
destructors are called in their correct order, reversing the calling sequence
of the constructors.
<p><br>Now let's focus our attention on two variants, in which we simulate a
non-fatal disastrous event to take place in the <code>Inner::fun()</code> function,
which is supposedly handled somewhere at the end of the function <code>main()</code>.
We'll consider two variants. The first variant will try to handle this
situation using <code>setjmp()</code> and <code>longjmp()</code>, the second variant will try to
handle this situation using <strong>C++</strong>'s exception mechanism.
<p><br>

<h3>12.2.1: No exceptions: the setjmp() and longjmp() approach</h3>
        <a name="exceptions/jmp"></a>
    In order to use <code>setjmp()</code> and <code>longjmp()</code> the basic program from section
<a href="cplusplus12.html#ExceptionExample">12.2</a> is slightly modified to contain a variable <code>jmp_buf
jmpBuf</code>. The function <code>Inner::fun()</code> now calls <code>longjmp</code>, simulating a
disastrous event, to be handled at the end of the function <code>main()</code>. In
<code>main()</code> we see the standard code defining the target location of the long
jump, using the function <code>setjmp()</code>. A zero returnvalue indicates the
initialization of the <code>jmp_buf</code> variable, upon which the <code>Outer::fun()</code>
function is called. This situation represents the `normal flow'. 
<p><br>To complete the simulation, the returnvalue of the program is zero <em>if only</em>
we would have been able to return from the function <code>Outer::fun()</code>
normally. However, as we know, this won't happen. <code>Inner:fun()</code> calls
<code>longjmp()</code>, returning to the <code>setjmp()</code> function, which (at this time) 
will <em>not</em> return a zero returnvalue. Hence, after calling <code>Inner::fun()</code>
from <code>Outer::fun()</code> the program proceeds beyond the <code>if</code>-statement in the
<code>main()</code> function, and the program terminates with the returnvalue 1.
<p><br>Now try to follow these steps by studying the next program source, modified
after the basic program given in section <a href="cplusplus12.html#ExceptionExample">12.2</a>:
<p><br><pre>
#include &lt;iostream.h&gt;
#include &lt;setjmp.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

class Inner
{
    public:
        Inner();
        ~Inner();
        void fun();
};

class Outer
{
    public:
        Outer();
        ~Outer();
        void fun();
};

jmp_buf
    jmpBuf;

Inner::Inner()
{
    cout &lt;&lt; "Inner constructor\n";
}    

void Inner::fun()
{
    cout &lt;&lt; "Inner fun()\n";
    longjmp(jmpBuf, 0);
}    

Inner::~Inner()
{
    cout &lt;&lt; "Inner destructor\n";
}    

Outer::Outer()
{
    cout &lt;&lt; "Outer constructor\n";
}    

Outer::~Outer()
{
    cout &lt;&lt; "Outer destructor\n";
}    

void Outer::fun()
{
    Inner
        in;
    cout &lt;&lt; "Outer fun\n";
    in.fun();
}    

int main()
{
    Outer
        out;

    if (!setjmp(jmpBuf))
    {
        out.fun();
        return (0);
    }

    return (1);
}







</pre>

<p><br>Running the above program produces the following output:
<p><br><pre>

    Outer constructor
    Inner constructor
    Outer fun
    Inner fun()
    Outer destructor

</pre>

As will be clear from this output, the destructor of the class <code>Inner</code> is
not executed. This is a direct result of the non-local characteristic of the
call to <code>longjmp()</code>: from the function <code>Inner::fun()</code> processing continues
immediately in the function <code>setjmp()</code> in <code>main()</code>: the call to
<code>Inner::~Inner()</code>, hiddenly placed at the end of <code>Outer::fun()</code> is never
executed. 
<p><br>Since the destructors of objects can easily be skipped when <code>longjmp()</code> and
<code>setjmp()</code> are used, it's probably best to skip these function completely in
<strong>C++</strong> program.

<h3>12.2.2: Exceptions: the preferred alternative</h3>
        <a name="exceptions/exception"></a>
    In <strong>C++</strong> <em>exceptions</em> are the best alternative to using 
<code>setjmp()</code> and <code>longjmp()</code>. In this section an example using exceptions is
presented. Again, the program is derived from the basic program, given in
section <a href="cplusplus12.html#ExceptionExample">12.2</a>. The syntax of exceptions will be covered
shortly, so please skip over the syntactical peculiarities like <code>throw, try</code>
and <code>catch</code>. Here comes the sourcetext:
<p><br><pre>
#include &lt;iostream.h&gt;

class Inner
{
    public:
        Inner();
        ~Inner();
        void fun();
};

class Outer
{
    public:
        Outer();
        ~Outer();
        void fun();
};

Inner::Inner()
{
    cout &lt;&lt; "Inner constructor\n";
}    

Inner::~Inner()
{
    cout &lt;&lt; "Inner destructor\n";
}    

void Inner::fun()
{
    cout &lt;&lt; "Inner fun\n";
    throw 1;
    cout &lt;&lt; "This statement is not executed\n";
}    

Outer::Outer()
{
    cout &lt;&lt; "Outer constructor\n";
}    

Outer::~Outer()
{
    cout &lt;&lt; "Outer destructor\n";
}    

void Outer::fun()
{
    Inner
        in;
    cout &lt;&lt; "Outer fun\n";
    in.fun();
}    


int main()
{
    Outer
        out;
    try
    {
        out.fun();
    }
    catch (...)
    {}
}





</pre>

<p><br>In this program an <em>exception</em> is thrown, where a <code>longjmp()</code> was used in
the program in section <a href="cplusplus12.html#ExceptionJmp">12.2.1</a>. The comparable construct for the
<code>setjmp()</code> call in that program is represented here by the <code>try</code> and
<code>catch</code> blocks. The <code>try</code> block surrounds statements (including function
calls) in which exceptions are thrown, the <code>catch</code> block may contain
statements to be executed just after throwing an exception.
<p><br>So, like section <a href="cplusplus12.html#ExceptionJmp">12.2.1</a>, the execution of function <code>Inner::fun()</code>
terminates, albeit with an exception, rather than a <code>longjmp()</code>. The
exception is caught in <code>main()</code>, and the program terminates. 
<p><br>Now look at the output generated by <em>this</em> program:
<p><br><pre>

    Outer constructor
    Inner constructor
    Outer fun
    Inner fun
    Inner destructor
    Outer destructor

</pre>

<p><br>Note that the destructor of the <code>Inner</code> object, created in <code>Outer::fun()</code>
is now called again. On the other hand, execution of the function
<code>Inner::fun()</code> really terminates at the <code>throw</code> statement: the insertion
of the text into <code>cout</code>, just beyond the <code>throw</code> statement, isn't
performed. 
<p><br>So, with our illustrations we hope to have raised your appetite for
exceptions by showing that
<ul>
    <li > Exceptions provide a means to break out of the normal flow control
without having to use a cascade of <code>return</code>-statements, and without having
to terminate the program.
    <li > Exceptions do not disrupt the activation of destructors, and are
therefore strongly preferred over the use of <code>setjmp()</code> and <code>longjmp()</code>.
</ul>
<p><br>

<h2>12.3: Throwing exceptions</h2>
    <a name="exceptions/throw"></a>
    Exceptions may be generated in a <code>throw</code> statement. The <code>throw</code> keyword is
followed by an expression, which results in a value of a certain type. For
example: 
        <pre>

    throw "Hello world";        // throws a char *
    throw 18;                   // throws an int
    throw string("hello");      // throws a string
        
</pre>

    Objects defined locally in functions are automatically destroyed once
exceptions are thrown within these functions. However, if the object itself is
thrown, the exception catcher receives a copy of the thrown object. This copy
is constructed just before the local object is destroyed.
<p><br>The next source illustrates this point. Within the function <code>Object::fun()</code>
a local <code>Object toThrow</code> is created, which is thereupon thrown as an
exception. The exception is caught outside of <code>Object::fun()</code>, in
<code>main()</code>. At this point the thrown object doesn't actually exist anymore,
<p><br>Let's first take a look at the sourcetext:
    <pre>
#include &lt;iostream.h&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

class Object
{
    public:
        Object(string name)
        :
            name(name)
        {
            cout &lt;&lt; "Object constructor of " &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; "\n";
        }    
        Object(Object const &amp;other)
        :
            name(other.name + " (copy)")
        {
            cout &lt;&lt; "Copy constructor for " &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; "\n";
        }    
        ~Object()
        {
            cout &lt;&lt; "Object destructor of " &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; "\n";
        }    
        void fun()
        {
            Object 
                toThrow("'local object'");
        
            cout &lt;&lt; "Object fun() of " &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; "\n";
            throw toThrow;
        }    
        void hello()
        {
            cout &lt;&lt; "Hello by " &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; "\n";
        }        
    private:
        string
            name;
};

int main()
{
    Object
        out("'main object'");

    try
    {
        out.fun();
    }
    catch (Object o)
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; "Caught exception\n";
        o.hello();
    }
}





</pre>

    The class <code>Object</code> defines some simple constructors and members. The
copy constructor is special in that it adds the text <code>" (copy)"</code> to the
received name, to allow us to monitor the construction and destruction of
objects somewhat more closely. The member function <code>fun()</code> generates the
exception, and throws its locally defined object. Just before the exception 
the following output is generated by the program:
        <pre>

Object constructor of 'main object'
Object constructor of 'local object'
Object fun() of 'main object'
        
</pre>

    Then the exception is generated, resulting in the next line of output:
        <pre>

Copy constructor for 'local object' (copy)
        
</pre>

    The <code>throw</code> clause receives the local object, and treats it as a value
argument: it creates a copy of the local object. Next, the exception is
processed. The local object is destroyed, and the catcher catches an
<code>Object</code>, which again is a value parameter. Hence, another copy is
created. We see the following lines:
        <pre>

Object destructor of 'local object'
Copy constructor for 'local object' (copy) (copy)
        
</pre>

    Now the message inside the catcher is displayed, and the hello member of
the object received by the catcher is called, showing us once again that we
received a copy of the copy of the local object of the <code>fun()</code>
member function: 
        <pre>

Caught exception
Hello by 'local object' (copy) (copy)
        
</pre>

    Now the program terminates, and the still living objects are destroyed in
their reversed order of creation:
        <pre>

Object destructor of 'local object' (copy) (copy)
Object destructor of 'local object' (copy)
Object destructor of 'main object'
        
</pre>

<p><br>If the catcher would have implemented so as to receive a reference to an
object (<code>catch (Object &amp;o)</code>), the double copy would have been avoided. In
that case the output of the program would have been:
        <pre>

Object constructor of 'main object'
Object constructor of 'local object'
Object fun() of 'main object'
Copy constructor for 'local object' (copy)
Object destructor of 'local object'
Caught exception
Hello by 'local object' (copy)
Object destructor of 'local object' (copy)
Object destructor of 'main object'
        
</pre>

    showing that only a single copy of the local object is used.
<p><br>Of course it's a bad idea to throw a <em>pointer</em> to a locally defined object:
the pointer is thrown, but the object to which the pointer refers dies once
the exception is thrown, and the catcher receives a wild pointer. Bad news.
<p><br>Summarizing, local objects are thrown as copied objects, pointers to local
objects should not be thrown. However, it is possible to throw pointers or
references to <em>dynamically</em> generated objects, taking care that the
generated object is properly deleted when the generated exception is
caught. 
<p><br>Exceptions are thrown in situations where a function can't continue its normal
task anymore, although the program is still able to continue. Imagine a
program which is an interactive calculator. The program continuously requests
expressions, which are then evaluated. In this case the parsing of the
expression may show syntax errors, and the evaluation of the expression may
result in expressions which can't be evaluated, e.g., because of the
expression resulting in a division by zero. A bit more sophistication would
allow the use of variables, and non-existing variables may be referred to.
<p><br>Each of these situations are enough reason to terminate the processing of the
expression at hand, but there's no need to terminate the program. Each
component of the processing of the expression may therefore throw an
exception. E.g.,
<pre>

    ...
    if (parse(expressionBuffer)) // parsing failed ?
        throw "Syntax error in expression";
    ...
    if (lookup(variableName))
        throw "Variable not defined";
    ...
    if (illegalDivision())
        throw "Division by zero is not defined";

</pre>

The location of these <code>throw</code> statements is immaterial: they may be
placed deeply nested within the program, or at a more superficial level.
Furthermore, <em>functions</em> may be used to generate the expression which is
thrown. A function
    <center><code>char const *formatMessage(char const *fmt, ...);</code> </center>
would allow us to throw more specific messages, like
<pre>

    if (lookup(variableName))
        throw formatMessage("Variable '%s' not defined", variableName);

</pre>

<h3>12.3.1: The empty throw statement</h3>
        <a name="exceptions/emptythrow"></a>
    Situations may arise in which it is required to inspect a thrown
exception. Depending on the nature of the received exception, the program may
continue its normal operation, or a serious event took place, requiring a more
drastic reaction by the program. In a server-client situation the client may
enter requests to the server in a queue. Every request placed in the queue is
normally answered by the server, telling the client that the request was
successfully completed, or that some sort of error has occurred. Actually, the
server may have died, and the client should be able to discover this calamity,
by not waiting indefinitely for the server to reply.
<p><br>In this situation an intermediate exception handler is called for. A thrown
exception is first inspected at the middle level. If possible it's processed
there. If it's not possible to process the exception at the middle level, 
it's passed on unaltered to a more superficial level, where the really tough
exceptions are handled.
<p><br>By placing an <em>empty</em> <code>throw</code> statement in the code handling an exception
the received exception is passed on to the next level able to process that
particular type of exception. 
<p><br>In our server-client situation a function 
    <center><code>initialExceptionHandler(char *exception)</code> </center>
could be designed to do so. The received message is inspected. If it's a
simple message it's processed, otherwise the exception is passed on to an
outer level. The implementation of <code>initialExceptionHandler()</code> shows the
empty <code>throw</code> statement:
<pre>

    void initialExceptionHandler(char *exception)
    {
        if (plainMessage(exception))
            handleTheMessage(exception);
        else
            throw;
    }

</pre>

As we will see below (section <a href="cplusplus12.html#ExceptionCatch">12.5</a>), the empty <code>throw</code>
statement passes on the exception received in a <code>catch</code>-block. Therefore, a
function like <code>initialExceptionHandler()</code> can be used for a variety of
thrown exceptions, as long as the argument used with
<code>initialExceptionHandler()</code> is compatible with the nature of the received
exception. 
<p><br>Does this sound intriguing? Suppose we have a class <code>Exception</code>,
containing a memberfunction <code>Exception::Type Exception::severity()</code>.
This memberfunction tells us (little wonder!) the severity of a thrown
exception. It might be <code>Message, Warning, Mistake, Error</code> or <code>Fatal</code>.
Furthermore, depending on the severity, a thrown exception may contain less or
more information, somehow processed by a function <code>process()</code>. In addition
to this, all exceptions have a plain-text producing memberfunction
<code>toString()</code>, telling us a bit more about the nature of the generated
exception. This smells a lot like polymorphism, showing <code>process()</code> 
as a virtual function for the derived classes <code>Message, Warning, Mistake,
Error</code> and <code>Fatal</code>. 
<p><br>Now the program may throw all these five types of exceptions Let's assume that
the <code>Message</code> and <code>Warning</code> exceptions are processable by our
<code>initialExceptionHandler()</code>. Then its code would become:
<pre>

    void initialExceptionHandler(Exception *e)
    {
                    // show the plain-text information
        cout &lt;&lt; e-&gt;toString() &lt;&lt; endl;  

                            // Can we process it ?
        if (e-&gt;severity &lt;= Exception::Warning)
            e-&gt;process();   // It's either a message
                            // or a warning
        else
            throw;          // No, pass it on
    }

</pre>

Due to polymorphism, <code>e-&gt;process()</code> will either process a <code>Message</code> or a
<code>Warning</code>. Thrown exceptions are generated as follows:
<pre>

    throw new Message(&lt;arguments&gt;);
    throw new Warning(&lt;arguments&gt;);
    throw new Mistake(&lt;arguments&gt;);
    throw new Error(&lt;arguments&gt;);
    throw new Fatal(&lt;arguments&gt;); 

</pre>
 
All of these exceptions are processable by our <code>initialExceptionHandler()</code>,
which may decide to pass exceptions upward for further processing or to
process exceptions itself.

<h2>12.4: The try block</h2>
    <a name="exceptions/try"></a>
    The <code>try</code>-block surrounds statements in which exceptions may be thrown. As
we have seen, the actual <code>throw</code> statement doesn't have to be placed within
the <code>try</code>-block, but may be placed in a function which is called from the
<code>try</code>-block, either directly or indirectly. 
<p><br>The keyword <code>try</code> is followed by a set of curly braces, which acts like a
standard <strong>C++</strong> compound statement: multiple statements and variable
definitions may be placed here. 
<p><br>It is possible (and very common) to create <em>levels</em> in which exceptions may
be thrown. For example, code within the <code>main()</code> function is surrounded by a
<code>try</code>-block, forming an outer level in which exceptions can be handled.
Within <code>main()</code>'s <code>try</code>-block, functions are called which may also contain
<code>try</code>-blocks, forming the next level in which exceptions may be placed. As
we have seen (in section <a href="cplusplus12.html#ExceptionEmptyThrow">12.3.1</a>) exceptions thrown in inner
level <code>try</code>-blocks may or may not be processed at that level. By placing an
empty <code>throw</code> in an exception handler, the thrown exception is passed on to
the next (outer) level.
<p><br>If an exception is thrown outside of any <code>try</code>-block, then the default way
to process (uncaught) exceptions is used, which is usually to abort the
program. Try to compile and run the following tiny program, and see what
happens: 
<pre>

    int main()
    {
        throw "hello";
    }

</pre>


<p><br><a name="ExceptionCatch"></a><a name="l243"></a>
<h2>12.5: Catching exceptions</h2>
    <a name="exceptions/catch"></a>
    The <code>catch</code>-block contains code that is executed when an exception is
thrown. Since <em>expressions</em> are thrown, the <code>catch</code>-block should know what
kind of exceptions it should handle. Therefore, the keyword <code>catch</code> is
followed by a parameter list having one parameter, which is of the type of the
expression of the thrown exception.
<p><br>So, an exception handler for <code>char *</code> exceptions will have the following
form:
<pre>

    catch (char const *message)
    {
        // code to handle the message
    }

</pre>

Earlier (section <a href="cplusplus12.html#ExceptionThrow">12.3</a>) we've seen that such a message doesn't
have to be thrown as static string. It's also possible for a function to
return a string, which is then thrown as an exception. However, if such a
function creates the string to be thrown as an exception <em>dynamically</em>, the
exception handler will normally have to delete the allocated memory lest
memory leaks away. 
<p><br>Generally close attention must be paid to the nature of the parameter of the
exception handler, to make sure that dynamically generated exceptions are
deleted once the handler has processed them. Of course, when an exception is
passed on upwards to an outer level exception handler, the received exception
should <em>not</em> be deleted by the inner level handler.
<p><br>Different exception types may be thrown: <code>char *\</code>s, <code>int</code>s, pointers or
references to objects, etc.: all these different types may be used in throwing
and catching exceptions. So, the exceptions appearing at the end of a
<code>try</code>-block may be of different types. In order to catch all the types that
may appear at the end of a <code>try</code>-block, multiple exception handlers (i.e.,
<code>catch</code>-blocks) may follow the <code>try</code>-block. 
<p><br>The <em>order</em> in which the exception handlers are placed is important. When an
exception is thrown, the first exception handler matching the type of the
thrown exception is selected, remaining exception handlers are skipped. So
only one exception handler following a <code>try</code>-block will be
executed. Consequently, exception handlers should be placed from the ones
having the most specific parameters to the ones having more general
parameters. For example, if exception handlers are defined for 
<code>char *</code>s and <code>void *\</code>s (i.e., any old pointer) then the exception
handler for the former exception type should be placed before the exception
handler for the latter type:
<pre>

    try
    {
        // code may throw char pointers
        // and other pointers
    }
    catch (char *message)
    {
        // code processing the char pointers
        // thrown as exceptions
    }
    catch (void *whatever)
    {
        // code processing all other pointers
        // thrown as exceptions
    }

</pre>

An alternative to construct different types of exception handlers for
different types of situations, it is of course also possible to design 
a specific class whose objects contain information about the reason for the
exception. Such an approach was discussed earlier, in section
<a href="cplusplus12.html#ExceptionEmptyThrow">12.3.1</a>. Using this approach, there's only one handler
required, since we <em>know</em> we won't throw other types of exceptions:
<pre>

    try
    {
        // code may throw only
        // Exception pointers
    }
    catch (Exception *e)
    {
        // code processing the Exception pointer
        delete e;    
    }

</pre>

The use of the <code>delete e</code> statement in the above code indicates that the
<code>Exception</code> object which could be thrown as an exception in the
<code>try</code>-block was created dynamically.
<p><br>When the code of an exception handler that is placed beyond a <code>try</code>-block
has been processed, the execution of the program continues beyond the last
exception handler following that <code>try</code>-block (unless the handler uses
<code>return, throw</code> or <code>exit()</code> to leave the function prematurely). So we have
the following cases:
<ul>
    <li > If <em>no</em> exception was thrown within the <code>try</code>-block no exception
handler is activated, and the execution continues from the last statement in
the <code>try</code>-block to the first statement beyond the last <code>catch</code>-block.
    <li > If an exception <em>was</em> thrown within the <code>try</code>-block but neither
the current level nor an other level contains an appropriate exception
handler, the program's default exception handler is called, usually aborting
the program.
    <li > If an exception was thrown within the <code>try</code>-block and an
appropriate  exception handler is available, then that the code of that
exception handler is exectuted. Following the execution of the code of the
exception handler, the execution of the program continues at 
the first statement beyond the last <code>catch</code>-block.
</ul>
In all cases a <code>throw</code>-statement will result in skipping all remaining
statements of the <code>try</code>-block in which the exception was thrown. However,
destructors of objects defined locally in the <code>try</code>-block <em>are</em> called,
and they are called before any exception handler's code is executed. 
<p><br>The actual construction of the <code>Exception</code> object may be performed in
various degrees of sophistication. Possibilities are using a plain
<code>new</code> operator, using static memberfunctions of the class <code>Exception</code>
dedicated to a particular kind of exception, returning a pointer to an
<code>Exception</code> object, or using objects of classes derived from the <code>class
Exception</code>, possibly involving polymorphism.

<h3>12.5.1: The default catcher</h3>
        <a name="exceptions/defaultcatch"></a>
    In cases where different types of exceptions can be thrown, only a limited set
of handlers may be required at a certain level of the program. Exceptions
whose types belong to that limited set are to be processed, all other
exceptions are treated differently, e.g., they are passed on to an outer level
of exception handling. 
<p><br>This situation is implemented using the default exception handler, which will
(because of the reason given in the previous section <a href="cplusplus12.html#ExceptionCatch">12.5</a>) be
placed beyond all other, more specific exception handlers. Often the default
exception handler will be used in combination with the empty throw statement,
discused in section <a href="cplusplus12.html#ExceptionEmptyThrow">12.3.1</a>. 
<p><br>Here is an example showing the use of a default exception handler:
<pre>

    try
    {
        // this code may throw
        // different types of 
        // exceptions
    }
    catch (char *message)
    {
        // code to process
        // char pointers
    }
    catch (int value)
    {
        // code to process
        // ints
    }
    catch (...)
    {
        // code to process other exceptions,
        // often passing the exception on
        // to outer level exception handlers:
            
        throw;
    } 

</pre>
 
The reason for passing unspecified exceptions on to outer level
exception handlers is simply the fact that they are unspecified: how would you
process an exception if you don't know its type? In these situations the outer
level exception handlers should of course know what exceptions other than
<code>char *</code>s and <code>int</code>s to expect....

<p><br><a name="l245"></a>
<h2>12.6: Declaring exception throwers</h2>
    <a name="exceptions/declaring"></a>
    Functions that are defined elsewhere may be linked to code using those
functions. These functions are normally declared in header files, either as
stand-alone functions or as member-functions of a class. 
<p><br>These external function may of course throw exceptions. The declaration of
such functions may contain a <em>function throw list</em>, in which the types of
the exceptions that can be thrown by the function are specified. For example,
a function that may throw <code>char *</code> and <code>int</code> exceptions can be declared as
    <center><code>void exceptionThrower() throw(char *, int);</code> </center>
<p><br>A function for which a function throw list was specified is not allowed to
throw other types of exceptions. A <em>run-time</em> error occurs if it does throw
other types of exceptions than mentioned in the function throw list.
<p><br>If a function throw list is specified in the declaration, it must also be
given in the definition of the function. For example, using declaration
<em>and</em> definition in the same example:
<pre>

    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    
    void intThrower() throw(int);
    void charP_IntThrower() throw (char *, int);
    
    void intThrower(int x) throw (int)
    {
        if (x)
            throw x;
    }
    
    void charP_IntThrower() throw (char *, int)
    {
        int
            x;
        cout &lt;&lt; "Enter an int: ";
        cout.flush();
        cin &gt;&gt; x;
    
        intThrower(x);
        throw "from charP_IntThrower() with love";
        
    }
        
    int main()
    {
        try
        {
             charP_IntThrower();
        }    
        catch (char *message)
        {
            cout &lt;&lt; "Text exception: " &lt;&lt; message &lt;&lt; endl;
        }
        catch (int value)
        {
            cout &lt;&lt; "Int exception: " &lt;&lt; value &lt;&lt; endl;
        }
        return (0);
    }

</pre>
       
In the function <code>charP_IntThrower()</code> the <code>throw</code> statement clearly throws
a <code>char *</code>. However, since <code>IntThrower()</code> may throw an <code>int</code> exception,
the function throw list of <code>charP_IntThrower()</code> must <em>also</em> contain
<code>int</code>. Try this: remove the <code>int</code> from the (two!) function throw lists,
compile and link the program and see what happens if you enter the value 5.
<p><br>If a function <em>doesn't</em> throw exceptions an empty function throw list may be
used. E.g.,
    <center><code>void noExceptions() throw ();</code> </center>
Again, the function definition must also contain the empty function throw list
in this case.
<p><br>If the function throw list is not used, the function may either throw
exceptions (of any kind) or not throw exceptions at all. Without a function
throw list all responsibilities of providing the correct handlers is in the
hands of the designer of the program....
