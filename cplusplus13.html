    Let's return to <code>friend</code>s once more. In section <a href="cplusplus04.html#ClassFriend">4.6</a> the 
possibility of declaring a function or class as a <em>friend</em> of a class was 
discussed. At the end of that section, we mentioned 
<p><br><ul>
<p><br><li > Friendship, when applied to program design, is an 
    <em>escape mechanism</em>
    which circumvents the principle of data hiding. Using friend classes
    should therefore be <em>minimized</em> to those cases where it is absolutely
    essential. 
<p><br><li > If friends are used, realize that the implementation of 
    classes or functions that are friends to other classes become 
    implementation dependent on these classes. In the above example: once the
    internal organization of the data of the class <code>A</code> changes, all its
    friends must be recompiled (and possibly modified) as well. 
<p><br><li > As a rule of thumb: <em>don't</em> use friend functions or classes.
<p><br></ul> 
<p><br>In our opinion, there are indeed very few reasons for using the <code>friend</code>
keyword. It violates the principle of data hiding, and makes the maintenance
of a class dependent on another class.
<p><br>Nonetheless, it might be worthwhile to look at some examples in which the 
<code>friend</code> keyword can be used profitably. Having seen such examples, 
the decision about whether or not to use <code>friend</code>s might be based on a 
somewhat more solid foundation than on a plain rule of thumb.
<p><br>At the onset, we remark that in our programming projects we <em>never</em> found
any convincing reason to resort to <code>friend</code>s. Having thus made our position 
clear, let's consider a situation where  it would be nice 
for an existing class to have access to another class. 
<p><br>Such a situation might occur when we would like to give an old class
access to a class  developed <em>later</em> in history. 
<p><br>However, while developing the older class, it was not yet known that the newer 
class would be developed later in time. E.g., the older class is distributed
in the runtime-library of a compiler, and the newer class is a class developed 
by us. 
<p><br>Consequently, no provisions were offered in the older class to access the 
information in the newer class. 
<p><br>Consider the following situation. Within the <code>C++</code> I/O-library the 
extraction <code>&gt;&gt;</code> and insertion <code>&lt;&lt;</code> operators 
may be used to extract from and to insert into a stream. 
<p><br>These operators can be given data of several 
types: <code>int, double, char *</code>, etc.. Now assume that we develop a class 
<code>String</code>. Objects of the <code>class String</code> can be 
given a string, and <code>String</code> objects can also <em>produce</em> other
<code>String</code> objects. 
<p><br>While it is possible to use the insertion operator to write the string that is 
stored in the object to a stream, it is not possible to use the <em>extraction</em>
operator, as illustrated by the following piece of code:
<p><br><pre>

    #include &lt;iostream&gt;

    class String
    {
        public:
            // ...
            void set(char const *s);
            char const *get() const;
        private:
            char
                *str;
    };
        
    void f()
    {
        String
            str;
            
        str.set("hello world");
            // Assign a value. Can't use 
            // cin &gt;&gt; str.set() or 
            // a similar construction
            
        cout &lt;&lt; str.get() &lt;&lt; endl;
            // this is ok.
    }

</pre>

Actually, the use of the insertion operator in combination with the 
<code>String</code> class is also a bit of a kludge: it isn't the <code>String</code> 
object that is inserted into the stream, but rather a string produced by
one of its members.
<p><br>Below we'll discuss a method to allow the insertion and extraction of 
<code>String</code> objects, based on the use of the  <code>friend</code> keyword.
<p><br>
<p><br><a name="l247"></a>
<h2>13.1: Inserting String objects into streams</h2>
    <a name="friends/insertion"></a>
    
Assume that we would like to be able to insert <code>String</code> objects into 
streams, rather than derivatives of <code>String</code> objects, like 
<code>char const *</code>'s. If we would be able to write <code>String</code> objects into
streams, we could be using code comparable to
<pre>

    int main()
    {
        String
            str("Hello world");
            
        cout &lt;&lt; "The string is: '" &lt;&lt; str &lt;&lt; "'" &lt;&lt; endl;
        return (0);
    }

</pre>

<p><br>Analogously, with the extraction operator, we would like to be able to write 
code comparable to the next example:
<pre>

    int main()
    {
        String
            str;
                   
        cout &lt;&lt; "Enter your string: ";

        cin &gt;&gt; str;
            
        cout &lt;&lt; "Got: '" &lt;&lt; str &lt;&lt; "'" &lt;&lt; endl;

        return (0);
    }

</pre>

<p><br>In this situation we would not have to rely on the availability of a 
particular member (like <code>char const *String::get()</code>), and we would be able to
fill a <code>String</code> object directly via the extraction operator, rather than
via an intermediate variable of a type understood by the <code>cin</code> stream.
<p><br>Even more central to the concept of object oriented programming: we would be
able to <em>ignore</em> the functionality of the <code>String</code> class in combination 
with <code>iostream</code> objects: our objective is, after all, to insert the 
information in the <code>String</code> <em>object</em> into the <code>cout</code> stream, and not 
to call a particular function to do so. 
<p><br>Once we're able to focus our attention on the object, rather than on its 
member functions, the above piece of code remains valid, no matter what 
internal organization the <code>String</code> object has. 
<p><br>
<p><br><a name="l248"></a>
<h2>13.2: An initial solution</h2>
    <a name="friends/initial"></a>
    Consider the following overloaded operator <code>&gt;&gt;</code>, to be used as an extraction
operator with a <code>String</code> object:
<pre>

    istream &amp;String::operator&gt;&gt;(istream &amp;is)
    {      
        char
            buffer[500];    
            // assume this buffer to be 
            // large enough. 

        is &gt;&gt; buffer;      // extraction

        delete str;     // free this-&gt;str 
                        // memory
                    
                        // assign new value
        str = strdupnew(buffer);
        
        return (is);    // return is-reference
    }

</pre>

The extraction operator can now be used with <code>String</code> 
objects. Unfortunately, this implementation produces awkward code. 
The extraction operator is 
part of the <code>String</code> class, so its <em>left</em> operand must be a 
<code>String</code> object. 
<p><br>As the <em>left</em> operand must be a <code>String</code> object, we're now forced to
use weird-looking code like the following, which can only partially be 
compiled. The numbered statements are annotated next.
<pre>

    void fun()
    {
        String
            s;
            
        s &gt;&gt; cin;           // (1)
            
        int x;
        
        s &gt;&gt; (cin &gt;&gt; x);    // (2)
            
        cin &gt;&gt; x &gt;&gt; s;      // (3)
    }

</pre>

<p><br><ol>
    <li>   In this statement <code>s</code> is the <em>left-hand</em> operator, and <code>cin</code>
      the <em>right-hand</em>, consequently, this statement represents 
      <em>extraction from a <code>cin</code> object into a <code>String</code> object</em>.
<p><br><li> In this statement parentheses are needed to indicate the proper
        ordering of the sub-expressions: first <code>cin &gt;&gt; x</code> is executed,
        producing an <code>istream &amp;</code>, which is then used as a right-hand operand
        with the <code>extraction</code> to <code>s</code>.
<p><br><li> This statement is what we want, but it doesn't compile: the 
    <code>istream</code>'s overloaded operator <code>&gt;&gt;</code> doesn't know how to extract 
    information into <code>String</code> objects.
<p><br></ol>
<p><br>
<p><br><a name="FriendsFriendfun"></a><a name="l249"></a>
<h2>13.3: Friend-functions</h2>
    <a name="friends/friendfun"></a>
    
The last statement of the previous example is in fact what we want. 
How can we accomplish the syntactical (and semantical) correctness 
of that last statement?
<p><br>A solution is to overload the <em>global</em> <code>&gt;&gt;</code> operator to accept a 
left-operand of the <code>istream &amp;</code> type, and a right operand of the 
<code>String &amp;</code> type, returning an <code>istream &amp;</code>. Its 
prototype is, therefore:
    <center><code>istream &amp;operator&gt;&gt;(istream &amp;is, String &amp;destination);</code> </center>
<p><br>To implement this function, the implementation given for the overloaded 
extraction operator of the <code>String</code> class can't simply be copied, since 
the private datamember <code>str</code> is accessed there. A small (and perfectly legal)
modification would be to access the <code>String</code>'s information via a
<code>char const *String::get() const</code> member, but this would again generate
a dependency on the <code>String::get()</code> function, which we would like to 
avoid.
<p><br>However, the need for overloading the extraction operator arose strictly in 
the context of the <code>String</code> class, and is in fact depending on the 
existence of that class. In this situation the overloading of the operator
could be considered an extension to the <code>String</code> class, rather than to
the <code>iostream</code> class.
<p><br>Next, since we consider the overloading of the <code>&gt;&gt;</code> operator in the context
of the <code>String</code> class an <em>extension of</em> the <code>String</code> class, we feel safe
to allow that function access to the private members of a <code>String</code> object,
instead of forcing the <code>operator&gt;&gt;()</code> function to assign the data members 
of the <code>String</code> object through the <code>String</code>'s member functions. 
<p><br>Access to the private data members of the <code>String</code> object is granted by 
declaring the <code>operator&gt;&gt;()</code> function to be a <code>friend</code> of the <code>String</code>
class:
<pre>

    #include &lt;iostream&gt;

    class String
    {
        friend istream &amp;operator&gt;&gt;(istream &amp;is, 
                                   String &amp;destination);
        public:
            // ...
        private:
            char
                *str;
    };

    istream &amp;operator&gt;&gt;(istream &amp;is, String &amp;destination)
    {      
        char
            buffer[500];    

        is &gt;&gt; buffer;                  // extraction

        delete destination.str;     // free old 'str' memory

        destination.str = strdupnew(buffer);
                                    // assign new value
        
        return (is);                // return istream-reference
    }
    
    void fun()
    {
        String
            s;
            
        cin &gt;&gt; s;   // application
        
        int
            x;
            
        cin &gt;&gt; x &gt;&gt; s;
                    // extraction order is now 
                    // as expected
    }

</pre>

<p><br>Note that nothing in the implementation of the <code>operator&gt;&gt;()</code> function
suggests that it's a friend of the <code>String</code> class. The compiler detects
this only from the <code>String</code> interface, where the <code>operator&gt;&gt;()</code> function
is declared as a friend.

<h3>13.3.1: Preventing the friend-keyword</h3>
        <a name="friends/prevent"></a>
    Now that we've seen that it's possible to define an overloaded <code>operator&gt;&gt;()</code>
function for the <code>String</code> class, it's hopefully clear that there is only 
very little reason to declare it as a friend of the <code>class String</code>, assuming
that the proper memberfunctions of the class are available. 
<p><br>On the other hand, declaring the <code>operator&gt;&gt;()</code> as a friend function isn't 
that much of a problem, as the <code>operator&gt;&gt;()</code> function can very well be 
interpreted as a true member function of the <code>class String</code>, although, due 
to a syntactical peculiarity, it cannot be defined as such. 
<p><br>To illustrate the possibility of overloading the <code>&gt;&gt;</code> operator for the 
<code>istream</code> and <code>String</code> combination, we present here the version which does 
not have to be declared as a <code>friend</code> in the <code>String</code> class interface. 
This implementation assumes that the class <code>String</code> has 
an overloaded operator <code>=</code>, accepting as r-value a <code>char const *</code>:
<pre>

    istream &amp;operator&gt;&gt;(istream &amp;lvalue, String &amp;rvalue)
    {      
        char
            buffer[500];    

        lvalue &gt;&gt; buffer;      // extraction

        rvalue = buffer;       // assignment
        
        return (lvalue);    // return istream-reference
    }

</pre>

No big deal, isn't it? After all, whether or not to use <code>friend</code> 
functions might purely be a matter of taste. As yet, we haven't come across a 
situation where <code>friend</code> functions are truly needed.
<p><br>
<p><br><a name="l251"></a>
<h2>13.4: Friend classes</h2>
    <a name="friends/classes"></a>
    
Situations may arise in which two classes doing closely related tasks are 
developed together. 
<p><br>For example, a window application can define a class <code>Window</code> 
to contain the information of a particular window, and a class <code>Screen</code>
shadowing the <code>Window</code> objects for those windows that are actually 
visible on the screen. 
<p><br>Assuming that the window-contents of a <code>Window</code> 
or <code>Screen</code> object are accessible through a <code>char *win</code> 
pointer, of <code>unsigned size</code> characters, an overloaded operator 
<code>!=</code> can be defined in one (or both) classes to compare the contents of 
a <code>Screen</code> and <code>Window</code> object immediately. Objects of the two
classes may then be compared directly, as in the following code fragment:
<p><br><pre>

    void fun()
    {
        Screen
            s;
        Window 
            w;
            
        // ... actions on s and w ...
        
        if (w != s)         // refresh the screen
            w.refresh(s);   // if w != s
    }

</pre>

<p><br>It is likely that the overloaded operator <code>!=</code> and other member 
functions of <code>w</code> (like <code>refresh()</code>) will benefit from direct access to 
the data of a <code>Screen</code> object. In this case the class <code>Screen</code>
may declare the class <code>Window</code> as a friend class, thus allowing 
<code>Window</code>'s member functions to access the private members of its objects.
<p><br>A (partial) implementation of this situation is:
<pre>

    class Window;       // forward declaration
    class Screen
    { 
        friend class Window;    // Window's object may
                                // access Screen's 
                                // private members
        public:
            // ...
        private:
            // ...
            char
                *win;
            unsigned
                size;
    };

    // =============================================
    // now in Window's context:
    
    int Window::operator!=(Screen const &amp;s)
    {
        return 
        (
            s.size != size      // accessing Screen's
            ||                  // private members
            !memcmp(win, s.win, size)
        );
    };

</pre>

<p><br>It is also possible to declare classes to be each other's friends, or
to declare a global function to be a friend in multiple classes. While there
may be situations where this is a useful thing to do, it is important to 
realize that these multiple friendships actually violate the principle of
encapsulation. 
<p><br>In the example we've been giving earlier for single <code>friend</code> functions, 
the implementation of such functions
can be placed in the same directory as the actual member 
functions of the class declaring the function to be its friend. Such functions
can very well be considered part of the class implementation, being
somewhat `eccentric` member functions.
Those functions will normally be inspected automatically
when the implementation of the data of the class is changed. 
<p><br>However, when a class itself is declared as a 
friend of another class, things become a little more complex. If the sources 
of classes are kept and maintained in different directories, it is not clear 
where the code of <code>Window::operator!=()</code> should be stored, as this 
function accesses private members of  both the class <code>Window</code> and 
<code>Screen</code>. Consequently caution should be  exercized when these 
situations arise. 
<p><br>In our opinion it's probably best to avoid friend classes, as they 
violate of the central principle of encapsulation.
