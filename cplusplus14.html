<p><br><a name="inherit/intro"></a>
    When programming in <strong>C</strong>, it is common to view problem solutions from a
<em>top-down</em> approach: functions and actions of the program are defined in
terms of sub-functions, which again are defined in sub-sub-functions, etc..
This yields a hierarchy of code: <code>main()</code> at the top, followed by a level
of functions which are called from <code>main()</code>, etc..
<p><br>In <strong>C++</strong> the dependencies between code and data can also be defined in
terms of <em>classes</em> which are <em>related to other classes</em>. This looks like
<em>composition</em> (see section <a href="cplusplus04.html#Composition">4.5</a>), where objects of a
class contain objects of another class as their data. But the relation which
is described here is of a different kind: a class can be <em>defined</em> by means
of an older, pre-existing, class. This leads to a situation in which a new
class has all the functionality of the older class, and additionally
introduces its own specific functionality.  Instead of composition, where a
given class <em>contains</em> another class, we mean here <em>derivation</em>, where a
given class <em>is</em> another class.
<p><br>Another term for derivation is <em>inheritance</em>: the new class inherits the
functionality of an existing class, while the existing class does not appear as
a data member in the definition of the new class. When speaking of inheritance
the existing class is called the <em>base class</em>, while the new class is
called the <em>derived class</em>.
<p><br>Derivation of classes is often used when the methodology of <strong>C++</strong> program
development is fully exploited. In this chapter we will first address the
syntactical possibilities which <strong>C++</strong> offers to derive classes from other
classes. Then we will address the peculiar extension to <strong>C</strong> which is thus
offered by <strong>C++</strong>.
<p><br>As we have seen the object-oriented approach to problem solving in the
introductory chapter (see section <a href="cplusplus02.html#OOP">2.4</a>), classes are identified
during the problem analysis, after which objects of the defined classes can be
declared to represent entities of the problem at hand. The classes are placed
in a hierarchy, where the top-level class contains the least functionality.
Each derivation and hence descent in the hierarchy adds functionality in the
class definition.
<p><br>In this chapter we shall use a simple vehicle classification system to build a
hierarchy of classes. The first class is <code>Vehicle</code>, which implements as its
functionality the possibility to set or retrieve the weight of a vehicle. The
next level in the object hierarchy are land-, water- and air vehicles.
<p><br>The initial object hierarchy is illustrated in figure <a href="cplusplus14.html#hierarchy">12</a>.
    <a name="hierarchy"></a><p><center><img src="images/hierarchy.gif" align="bottom" alt="figure 12 is shown here."><br>

<p><br><a name="VehicleSystem"></a><a name="l253"></a>
<h2>14.1: Related types</h2>
    <a name="inherit/related"></a>
    The relationship between the proposed classes representing different kinds of
vehicles is further illustrated here. The figure shows the object hierarchy in
vertical direction: an <code>Auto</code> is a special case of a <code>Land</code> vehicle,
which in turn is a special case of a <code>Vehicle</code>. 
<p><br>The class <code>Vehicle</code> is thus the `greatest common denominator' in the
classification system. For the sake of the example we implement in this class
the functionality to store and retrieve the weight of a vehicle:
<pre>

    class Vehicle
    {
        public:
            // constructors
            Vehicle();
            Vehicle(int wt);

            // interface
            int getweight() const;
            void setweight(int wt);
            
        private:
            // data
            int weight;
    };

</pre>

Using this class, the weight of a vehicle can be defined as soon as the
corresponding object is created. At a later stage the weight can be re-defined
or retrieved.
<p><br>To represent vehicles which travel over land, a new class <code>Land</code> can be
defined with the functionality of a <code>Vehicle</code>, but in addition its own
specific information. For the sake of the example we assume that we are
interested in the speed of land vehicles <em>and</em> in their weight. The
relationship between <code>Vehicle</code>s and <code>Land</code>s could of course be
represented with composition, but that would be awkward: composition would
suggest that a <code>Land</code> vehicle <em>contains</em> a vehicle, while the
relationship should be that the <code>Land</code> vehicle <em>is</em> a special case of a
vehicle.
<p><br>A relationship in terms of composition would also introduce needless code.
E.g., consider the following code fragment which shows a class <code>Land</code> using
composition (only the <code>setweight()</code> functionality is shown):
<pre>

    class Land
    {
        public:
            void setweight(int wt);
        private:
            Vehicle v;      // composed Vehicle
    };

    void Land::setweight(int wt)
    {
        v.setweight(wt);
    }

</pre>

Using composition, the <code>setweight()</code> function of the class <code>Land</code> would
only serve to pass its argument to <code>Vehicle::setweight()</code>. Thus, as far as
weight handling is concerned,
<code>Land::setweight()</code> would introduce no extra functionality, just extra
code. Clearly this code duplication is redundant: a <code>Land</code> should <em>be</em> a
<code>Vehicle</code>, and not: a <code>Land</code> should <em>contain</em> a <code>Vehicle</code>.
<p><br>The relationship is better achieved with inheritance: <code>Land</code> is
<em>derived</em> from <code>Vehicle</code>, in which <code>Vehicle</code> is the base class of the
derivation.
<pre>

    class Land: public Vehicle
    {
        public:
            // constructors
            Land();
            Land(int wt, int sp);

            // interface
            void setspeed(int sp);
            int getspeed() const;
            
        private:
            // data
            int speed;
    };

</pre>

By postfixing the class name <code>Land</code> in its definition by 
<code>public Vehicle</code> the derivation is defined: 
the class <code>Land</code> now contains all the
functionality of its base class <code>Vehicle</code> plus its own specific
information. The extra functionality consists here of a constructor with two
arguments and interface functions to access the <code>speed</code> data
member. (The derivation in this example mentions the keyword
<code>public</code>. <strong>C++</strong> also implements <code>private</code> derivation, which is not
often used and which we will therefore leave to the reader to
uncover.).
<p><br>To illustrate the use of the derived class <code>Land</code> consider the following
example:
<pre>

    Land
        veh(1200, 145);

    int main()
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; "Vehicle weighs " &lt;&lt; veh.getweight() &lt;&lt; endl
             &lt;&lt; "Speed is " &lt;&lt; veh.getspeed() &lt;&lt; endl;

        return (0);
    }

</pre>

This example shows two features of derivation. First, <code>getweight()</code> is no
direct member of a <code>Land</code>. Nevertheless it is used in <code>veh.getweight()</code>.
This member function is an implicit part of the class, inherited from its
`parent' vehicle.
<p><br>Second, although the derived class <code>Land</code> now contains the functionality of
<code>Vehicle</code>, the <code>private</code> fields of <code>Vehicle</code> remain private in the
sense that they can only be accessed by member functions of <code>Vehicle</code>
itself. This means that the member functions of <code>Land</code> <em>must</em> use the
interface functions (<code>getweight()</code>, <code>setweight()</code>) to address the
<code>weight</code> field; just as any other code outside the <code>Vehicle</code> class. This
restriction is necessary so that the principle of data hiding thus remains
ensured. The class <code>Vehicle</code> could, e.g., be recoded and recompiled, after
which the program could be relinked. The class <code>Land</code> itself could remain
unchanged.
<p><br>Actually, the previous remark is not quite right: If the internal organization
of the <code>Vehicle</code> changes, then the internal organization of the <code>Land</code>
objects, containing the data of <code>Vehicle</code>, changes as well. This means that
objects of the <code>Land</code> class, after changing <code>Vehicle</code>, might require more
(or less) memory than before the modification. However, in such a situation we
still don't have to worry about the use of memberfunctions of the parent class
<code>Vehicle</code> in the class <code>Land</code>. We might have to recompile the <code>Vehicle</code>
sources, though, as the relative locations of the data members within the
<code>Vehicle</code> objects will have changed due to the modification of the <code>Land</code>
class.
<p><br>To play it safe, classes which are derived from other classes must be fully
recompiled (but don't have to be modified) after changing the <em>data
organization</em> of their base class(es).  As adding new <em>memberfunctions</em> to
the base class doesn't alter the data organization, no such recompilation is
needed after adding new <em>memberfunctions</em>. (A subtle point to note, however,
is that adding a new memberfunction that happens to be the <em>first</em>
<a href="cplusplus15.html#virfunc"><em>virtual</em> memberfunction</a> of a class results in a <a href="cplusplus15.html#howpolymorfism">hidden
pointer</a> to a table of pointers to virtual functions. This
topic is discussed further in chapter <a href="cplusplus15.html#Polymorphism">15</a>).
<p><br>In the following example we assume that the class <code>Auto</code>, representing
automobiles, should be able to contain the weight, speed and name of a car.
This class is therefore derived from <code>Land</code>:
<pre>

    class Auto: public Land
    {
        public:
            // constructors
            Auto();
            Auto(int wt, int sp, char const *nm);

            // copy constructor
            Auto(Auto const &amp;other);

            // assignment
            Auto const &amp;operator=(Auto const &amp;other);

            // destructor
            ~Auto();

            // interface
            char const *getname() const;
            void setname(char const *nm);

        private:
            // data
            char const *name;
    };

</pre>

In the above class definition, <code>Auto</code> is derived from <code>Land</code>, which in
turn is derived from <code>Vehicle</code>. This is called <em>nested</em>
derivation: <code>Land</code> is called <code>Auto</code>'s <em>direct base class</em>, 
while <code>Vehicle</code> is called the <em>the indirect base class</em>.
<p><br>Note the presence of a destructor, a copy constructor and overloaded
assignment function in the class <code>Auto</code>. Since this class uses a pointer to
reach allocated memory, these tools are needed.

<h2>14.2: The constructor of a derived class</h2>
    <a name="inherit/constructor"></a>
    
As mentioned earlier, a derived class inherits the functionality from its
base class. In this section we shall describe the effects of the inheritance
on the constructor of a derived class.
<p><br>As can be seen from the definition of the class <code>Land</code>, a constructor
exists to set both the <code>weight</code> and the <code>speed</code> of an object. The
poor-man's implementation of this constructor could be:
<pre>

    Land::Land (int wt, int sp)
    {
        setweight(wt);
        setspeed(sp);
    }

</pre>

This implementation has the following disadvantage. The <strong>C++</strong> compiler will
generate code to call the default constructor of a base class from each
constructor in the derived class, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
This can be compared to the situation which arises in composed objects (see
section <a href="cplusplus04.html#Composition">4.5</a>).
<p><br>Consequently, in the above implementation (a) the default
constructor of a <code>Vehicle</code> is called, which probably initializes the weight
of the vehicle, and (b) subsequently the weight is redefined by calling
<code>setweight()</code>.
<p><br>A better solution is of course to call directly the constructor of
<code>Vehicle</code> expecting an <code>int</code> argument.  The syntax to achieve this
is to mention the constructor to be called (supplied with an argument) 
immediately following the argument list of the constructor of the derived 
class itself:
<pre>

    Land::Land(int wt, int sp)
    : 
        Vehicle(wt)
    {
        setspeed(sp);
    }

</pre>
    

<p><br><a name="l255"></a>
<h2>14.3: The destructor of a derived class</h2>
    <a name="inherit/destructor"></a>
    Destructors of classes are called automatically when an object is
destroyed. This rule also holds true for objects of classes that are derived
from other classes. Assume we have the following situation:
<p><br><pre>

    class Base
    {
        public:
            ...         // members
            ~Base();    // destructor
    };

    class Derived
    {
        public:
            ...         // members
            ~Derived(); // destructor
    }

    ...                 // other code

    int main()
    {
        Derived
            derived;

        ...
        return (0);
    }

</pre>

<p><br>At the end of the <code>main()</code> function, the <code>derived</code> object ceases to
exists. Hence, its destructor <code>Derived::~Derived()</code> is called. However,
since <code>derived</code> is also a <code>Base</code> object, the <code>Base::~Base()</code> destructor
is called as well. 
<p><br>It is <em>not</em> necessary to call the <code>Base::~Base()</code> destructor explicitly
from the <code>Derived::~Derived()</code> destructor. 
<p><br>Constructors and destructors are called in a stack-like fashion: when
<code>derived</code> is constructed, the appropriate <code>Base</code> constructor is called
first, then the appropriate <code>Derived</code> constructor is called. When
<code>derived</code> is destroyed, the <code>Derived</code> destructor is called first, and then
the <code>Base</code> destructor is called for that object. In general, a derived class
destructor is called before a base class destructor is called.

<h2>14.4: Redefining member functions</h2>
    <a name="inherit/redefining"></a>
    
The actions of all functions which are defined in a base class (and which are
therefore also available in derived classes) can be redefined. This feature is
illustrated in this section.
<p><br>Let's assume that the vehicle classification system should be able to
represent trucks, which consist of a two parts: the front engine, which pulls
a trailer. Both the front engine and the trailer have their own weights,
but the <code>getweight()</code> function should return the combined weight.
<p><br>The definition of a <code>Truck</code> therefore starts with the class definition,
derived from <code>Auto</code> but expanded to hold one more <code>int</code> field to
represent additional weight information. Here we choose to represent the
weight of the front part of the truck in the <code>Auto</code> class and to store the
weight of the trailer in an additional field:
<pre>

    class Truck: public Auto
    {
        public:
            // constructors
            Truck();
            Truck(int engine_wt, int sp, char const *nm,
                  int trailer_wt);

            // interface: to set two weight fields
            void setweight(int engine_wt, int trailer_wt);
            // and to return combined weight
            int getweight() const;

        private:
            // data
            int trailer_weight;
    };

    // example of constructor
    Truck::Truck(int engine_wt, int sp, char const *nm,
                 int trailer_wt)
    :
        Auto(engine_wt, sp, nm)
    {
        trailer_weight = trailer_wt;
    }

</pre>
    
Note that the class <code>Truck</code> now contains two functions which are already
present in the base class:
<p><br><ul>
    <li > The function <code>setweight()</code> is already defined in <code>Auto</code>.  The
redefinition in <code>Truck</code> poses no problem: this functionality is simply
redefined to perform actions which are specific to a <code>Truck</code> object.<br>
    The definition of a new version of <code>setweight()</code> in the class <code>Truck</code>
will <em>hide</em> the version of <code>Auto</code> (which is the version defined in
<code>Vehicle</code>: for a <code>Truck</code> only a <code>setweight()</code> function with two <code>int</code>
arguments can be used.<br>
    However, note that the <code>Vehicle</code>'s <code>setweight()</code> function remains
available. But, as the <code>Auto::setweight()</code> function is
hidden it must be called explicitly when needed (e.g., inside
<code>Truck::setweight()</code>. This is required even though <code>Auto::setweight()</code> has
only one <code>int</code> argument, and one could argue that <code>Auto::setweight()</code> and
<code>Truck::setweight()</code> are merely overloaded functions within the class
<code>Truck</code>. So, the implementation of the function <code>Truck::setweight()</code> could
be:
 <pre>

    void Truck::setweight(int engine_wt, int trailer_wt)
    {
        trailer_weight = trailer_wt;
        Auto::setweight(engine_wt);     // note: Auto:: is required
    }   
 
</pre>

    <li > Outside of the class the <code>Auto</code>-version of <code>setweight()</code> is
accessed through the scope resolution operator. So, if a <code>Truck t</code> needs to
set its <code>Auto</code> weight, it must use
            <center><code>t.Auto::setweight(x)</code> </center>
    <li > An alternative to using the scope resolution operator is to include
the base-class functions in the class interface as inline functions. This
might be an elegant solution for the occasional function. E.g., if the
interface of the <code>class Truck</code> contains
        <pre>

    void setweight(int engine_wt)
    {
        Auto::setweight(engine_wt);
    }
        
</pre>

    then the single argument <code>setweight()</code> function can be used by <code>Truck</code>
objects without using the scope resolution operator. As the function is
defined inline, no overhead of an extra function call is involved.
    <li > The function <code>getweight()</code> is also already defined in
<code>Vehicle</code>, with the same argument list as in <code>Truck</code>. In this case,
the class <code>Truck</code> <em>redefines</em> this member function.
<p><br>The next code fragment presents the redefined function 
<code>Truck::getweight()</code>:
 <pre>

    int Truck::getweight() const
    {
        return
            (                           // sum of:
                Auto::getweight() +     //   engine part plus
                trailer_weight          //   the trailer
            );
    }
 
</pre>

</ul>
<p><br>The following example shows the actual usage of the member functions of the
class <code>Truck</code> to display several of its weights:
 <pre>

    int main()
    {
        Land
            veh(1200, 145);
   
        Truck 
            lorry(3000, 120, "Juggernaut", 2500);
   
        lorry.Vehicle::setweight(4000);
   
        cout &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; "Truck weighs " &lt;&lt; lorry.Vehicle::getweight() &lt;&lt; endl
            &lt;&lt; "Truck + trailer weighs " &lt;&lt; lorry.getweight() &lt;&lt; endl
            &lt;&lt; "Speed is " &lt;&lt; lorry.getspeed() &lt;&lt; endl
            &lt;&lt; "Name is " &lt;&lt; lorry.getname() &lt;&lt; endl;
        return (0);
    }
 
</pre>

    Note the explicit call to <code>Vehicle::setweight(4000)</code>: in order to reach
the hidden memberfunction <code>Vehicle::setweight()</code>, which <em>is</em> part of the
set of memberfunctions available to the class <code>Vehicle</code>, is must be called
explicitly, using the <code>Vehicle::</code> scope resolution. As said, this is
remarkable, because <code>Vehicle::setweight()</code> can very well be considered an
overloaded version of <code>Truck::setweight()</code>. 
    The situation with <code>Vehicle::getweight()</code> and <code>Truck::getweight()</code> is
a different one: here the function <code>Truck::getweight()</code> is a
<em>redefinition</em> of <code>Vehicle::getweight()</code>, so in order to reach
<code>Vehicle::getweight()</code> a scope resolution operation (<code>Vehicle::</code>) is
required.

<h2>14.5: Multiple inheritance</h2>
    <a name="inherit/multiple"></a>
    In the previously described derivations, a class was always derived from
<em>one</em> base class. <strong>C++</strong> also implements <em>multiple derivation</em>, in
which a class is derived from several base classes and hence inherits the
functionality from more than one `parent' at the same time.
<p><br>For example, let's assume that a class <code>Engine</code> exists with the
functionality to store information about an engine: the serial number, the
power, the type of fuel, etc.:
<pre>

    class Engine
    {
        public:
            // constructors and such
            Engine();
            Engine(char const *serial_nr, int power,
                   char const *fuel_type);

            // tools needed as we have pointers in the class
            Engine(Engine const &amp;other);
            Engine const &amp;operator=(Engine const &amp;other);

            ~Engine();

            // interface to get/set stuff
            void setserial(char const *serial_nr);
            void setpower(int power);
            void setfueltype(char const *type);

            char const *getserial() const;
            int getpower() const;
            char const *getfueltype() const;

        private:
            // data
            char const 
                *serial_number, 
                *fuel_type;
            int 
                power;
    };

</pre>

To represent an <code>Auto</code> but with all information about the engine, a class
<code>MotorCar</code> can be derived from <code>Auto</code> <code>and</code> from <code>Engine</code>,
as illustrated in the below listing. By using multiple derivation, the
functionality of an <code>Auto</code> <em>and</em> of an <code>Engine</code> are combined
into a <code>MotorCar</code>:
<pre>

    class MotorCar
    : 
        public Auto, 
        public Engine
    {
        public:
            // constructors
            MotorCar();
            MotorCar(int wt, int sp, char const *nm,
                     char const *ser, int pow, char const *fuel);
    };                

    MotorCar::MotorCar(int wt, int sp, char const *nm,
                       char const *ser, int pow, char const *fuel)
    : 
        Engine (ser, pow, fuel), 
        Auto (wt, sp, nm)
    {
    }

</pre>

<p><br>A few remarks concerning this derivation are:
<p><br><ul>
<p><br><li > The keyword <code>public</code> is present both before the classname
    <code>Auto</code> and before the classname <code>Engine</code>. This is so because the
    default derivation in <strong>C++</strong> is <code>private</code>: the keyword <code>public</code>
    must be repeated before each base class specification.
<p><br><li > The multiply derived class <code>MotorCar</code> introduces no `extra'
    functionality of its own, but only combines two pre-existing types into
    one aggregate type. Thus, <strong>C++</strong> offers the possibility to simply sweep
    multiple simple types into one more complex type.
<p><br>This feature of <strong>C++</strong> is very often used. Usually it pays to
    develop `simple' classes each with its strict well-defined functionality.
    More functionality can always be achieved by combining several small
    classes.
<p><br><li > The constructor which expects six arguments contains no code of its
    own. Its only purpose is to activate the constructors of the base classes.
    Similarly, the class definition contains no data or interface functions:
    here it is sufficient that all interface is inherited from the base
    classes.
<p><br></ul>
<p><br>Note also the syntax of the constructor: following the argument list, the two
base class constructors are called, each supplied with the correct arguments.
It is also noteworthy that the <em>order</em> in which the constructors are called
is defined by the <em>interface</em>, and <em>not</em> by the implementation (i.e.,
by the statement in the constructor of the class <code>MotorCar</code>. 
This implies that:
<ul>
<p><br><li > First, the constructor of <code>Auto</code> is called, since <code>MotorCar</code>
    is first of all derived from <code>Auto</code>.
<p><br><li > Then, the constructor of <code>Engine</code> is called,
<p><br><li > Last, any actions of the constructor of <code>MotorCar</code> itself are
    executed (in this example, none).
<p><br></ul>
Lastly, it should be noted that the multiple derivation in this example may
feel a bit awkward: the derivation implies that <code>MotorCar</code> <em>is</em>
an <code>Auto</code> and at the same time it <em>is</em> an <code>Engine</code>. A
relationship `a <code>MotorCar</code> <em>has</em> an <code>Engine</code>' would be
expressed as composition, by including an <code>Engine</code> object in the data
of a <code>MotorCar</code>. But using composition, unnecessary code
duplication occurs in the interface functions for an <code>Engine</code> 
(here we assume that a composed object <code>engine</code> of the class <code>Engine</code> 
exists in a <code>MotorCar</code>):
<pre>

    void MotorCar::setpower(int pow)
    {
        engine.setpower(pow);
    }

    int MotorCar::getpower() const
    {
        return (engine.getpower());
    }

    // etcetera, repeated for set/getserial(),
    // and set/getfueltype()

</pre>

<p><br>Clearly, such simple interface functions are avoided completely by using
derivation. Alternatively, when insisting on the <code>has</code> relationship and
hence on composition, the interface functions could have been avoided by using
<code>inline</code> functions.

<h2>14.6: Conversions between base classes and derived classes</h2>
    <a name="inherit/conversions"></a>
    When inheritance is used in the definition of classes, it can be said that an
object of a derived class is at the same time an object of the base class.
This has important consequences for the assignment of objects, and for the
situation where pointers or references to such objects are used. Both
situations will be discussed next.

<p><br><a name="l259"></a>
<h3>14.6.1: Conversions in object assignments</h3>
        <a name="inherit/objectconv"></a>
    We define two objects, one of a base class and one of a derived class:
<pre>

    Vehicle
        v(900);                 // vehicle with weight 900 kg
    Auto
        a(1200, 130, "Ford");   // automobile with weight 1200 kg,
                                // max speed 130 km/h, make Ford

</pre>

<p><br>The object <code>a</code> is now initialized with its specific values. However, an
<code>Auto</code> is at the same time a <code>Vehicle</code>, which makes the 
assignment <em>from</em> a derived object <em>to</em> a base object possible:
<pre>

    v = a;

</pre>

The effect of this assignment is that the object <code>v</code> now receives the value
1200 as its <code>weight</code> field. A <code>Vehicle</code> has neither a <code>speed</code> nor a
<code>name</code> field: these data are therefore not assigned.
<p><br>The conversion from a base object to a derived object, however, is problematic:
In a statement like 
<pre>

    a = v;

</pre>

it isn't clear what data to enter into the fields 
<code>speed</code> and <code>name</code> of the <code>Auto</code> object <code>a</code>, 
as they are missing in the
<code>Vehicle</code> object <code>v</code>. Such an assignment is therefore not accepted by
the compiler.
<p><br>The following general rule applies: when assigning related objects, an
assignment in which some data are dropped is legal. However, an assignment
where data would have to be left blank is <em>not</em> legal. This rule is a
syntactic one: it also applies when the classes in question have their
overloaded assignment functions.
<p><br>The conversion of an object of a base class to an object of a derived class
could of course be explicitly defined using a dedicated constructor.
E.g., to achieve compilability of a statement
<pre>

    a = v;

</pre>

the class <code>Auto</code> would need an assignment function accepting a <code>Vehicle</code>
as its argument. It would be the programmer's responsibility to decide
what to do with the missing data:
<pre>

    Auto const &amp;Auto::operator=(Vehicle const &amp;veh)
    {
        setweight (veh.getweight());
        .
        .  code to handle other fields should
        .  be supplied here
        .
    }

</pre>


<p><br><a name="l260"></a>
<h3>14.6.2: Conversions in pointer assignments</h3>
        <a name="inherit/pointerconv"></a>
    We define the following objects and one pointer variable:
<pre>

    Land
        land(1200, 130);
    Auto
        auto(500, 75, "Daf");
    Truck
        truck(2600, 120, "Mercedes", 6000);
    Vehicle
        *vp;

</pre>

<p><br>Subsequently we can assign <code>vp</code> to the addresses of the three objects of
the derived classes:
<pre>

    vp = &amp;land;
    vp = &amp;auto;
    vp = &amp;truck;

</pre>

<p><br>Each of these assignments is perfectly legal. However, an implicit conversion
of the type of the derived class to a <code>Vehicle</code> is made, since <code>vp</code> is
defined as a pointer to a <code>Vehicle</code>. Hence, when using <code>vp</code> only the
member functions which manipulate the <code>weight</code> can be called, as this is the
<em>only</em> functionality of a <code>Vehicle</code> and thus it is
the only functionality which is available when a pointer to a <code>Vehicle</code> is
used.
<p><br>The same reasoning holds true for references to <code>Vehicles</code>. If, e.g., a
function is defined with a <code>Vehicle</code> reference parameter, the function may
be passed an object of a class that is derived from <code>Vehicle</code>. Inside the
function, the specific <code>Vehicle</code> members of the object of the derived class
remain accessible. This analogy between pointers and references holds true in
all cases. Remember that a reference is nothing but a pointer in disguise: it
mimics a plain variable, but is actually a pointer.
<p><br>This restriction in functionality has furthermore an important effect for the
class <code>Truck</code>. After the statement <code>vp = &amp;truck</code>, <code>vp</code> points to a
<code>Truck</code> object. Nevertheless, <code>vp-&gt;getweight()</code> will return 2600; and not
8600 (the combined weight of the cabin and of the trailer: 2600 + 6000),
which would have been returned by <code>t.getweight()</code>.
<p><br>When a function is called via a pointer to an object, then the 
<em>type of the pointer</em> and not the object itself determines which member 
functions are available and executed. 
In other words, <strong>C++</strong> implicitly converts the type of an
object reached via a pointer to the type of the pointer pointing to the 
object. 
<p><br>There is of course a way around the implicit conversion, which is an explicit
type cast:
<pre>

    Truck
        truck;
    Vehicle
        *vp;

    vp = &amp;truck;        // vp now points to a truck object

    Truck
        *trp;

    trp = (Truck *) vp;
    printf ("Make: %s\n", trp-&gt;getname());

</pre>

<p><br>The second to last statement of the code fragment above specifically casts a
<code>Vehicle *</code> variable to a <code>Truck *</code> in order to assign the value to the
pointer <code>trp</code>. This code will <em>only</em> work if <code>vp</code> indeed points to a
<code>Truck</code> and hence a function <code>getname()</code> is available. Otherwise
the program may show some unexpected behavior.

<p><br><a name="VStorage"></a><a name="l261"></a>
<h2>14.7: Storing base class pointers</h2>
    <a name="inherit/storing"></a>
    The fact that pointers to a base class can be used to reach derived classes
can be used to develop general-purpose classes which can process objects of
the derived types. A typical example of such processing is the storage of
objects, be it in an array, a list, a tree or whichever storage method may be
appropriate. Classes which are designed to store objects of other classes are
therefore often called <em>container classes</em>. The stored objects are     
<em>contained</em> in the container class.
<p><br>As an example we present the class <code>VStorage</code>, which is used to store
pointers to <code>Vehicle</code>s. The actual pointers may be addresses of
<code>Vehicle</code>s themselves, but also may refer to derived types such as
<code>Auto</code>s.
<p><br>The definition of the class is the following:
<pre>

    class VStorage
    {
        public:
            VStorage();
            VSTorage(VStorage const &amp;other);
            ~VStorage();
            VStorage const &amp;operator=(VStorage const &amp;other);

                                // add Vehicle&amp; to storage
            void add(Vehicle const &amp;vehicle);
                                // retrieve first Vehicle *
            Vehicle const *getfirst() const;
                                // retrieve next Vehicle *
            Vehicle const *getnext() const;

        private:
            // data
            Vehicle 
                **storage;
            int 
                nstored, 
                current;
    };

</pre>

<p><br>Concerning this class definition we note:
<ul>
<p><br><li > The class contains three interface functions: one to add a
    <code>Vehicle &amp;</code> to the storage, one to retrieve the first <code>Vehicle *</code> from
    the storage, and one to retrieve next pointers until no more are in the
    storage.
<p><br>An illustration of the use of this class is given in the next
    example:
    <pre>

        Land
            land(200, 20);          // weight 200, speed 20
        Auto
            auto(1200, 130, "Ford");// weight 1200 , speed 130,
                                    // make Ford
        VStorage
            garage;                 // the storage

        garage.add(land);           // add to storage
        garage.add(auto);

        Vehicle const
            *anyp;
        int
            total_wt = 0;

        for (anyp = garage.getfirst(); anyp; anyp = garage.getnext())
            total_wt += anyp-&gt;getweight();

        cout &lt;&lt; "Total weight: " &lt;&lt; total_wt &lt;&lt; endl;
    
</pre>

<p><br>This example demonstrates how derived types (one <code>Auto</code> and one
    <code>Land</code>) are implicitly converted to their base type (a <code>Vehicle &amp;</code>),
    so that they can be stored in a <code>VStorage</code>. Base-type objects are then
    retrieved from the storage. The function <code>getweight()</code>, 
    defined in the  base class and the derived classes, 
    is therupon used to compute the total weight.
<p><br><li > Furthermore, the class <code>VStorage</code> contains all the tools to
    ensure that two <code>VStorage</code> objects can be assigned to one another etc..
    These tools are the overloaded assignment function and the copy
    constructor.
<p><br><li > The actual internal workings of the class only become apparent once
    the <code>private</code> section is seen. The class <code>VStorage</code> maintains an
    array of pointers to <code>Vehicle</code>s and needs two <code>int</code>s to store how
    many objects are in the storage and which the `current' index is, to be
    returned by <code>getnext()</code>.
<p><br></ul>
<p><br>The class <code>VStorage</code> shall not be further elaborated; similar examples
shall appear in the next chapters. It is however <em>very</em> noteworthy that by
providing class derivation and base/derived conversions, <strong>C++</strong> presents a
powerful tool: these features of <strong>C++</strong> allow the processing of all derived
types by one generic class.
<p><br>The above class <code>VStorage</code> could even be used to store all types which may
be
derived from a <code>Vehicle</code> in the future. It seems a bit paradoxical that the
class should be able to use code which isn't even there yet, but there is no
real paradox: <code>VStorage</code> uses a certain <em>protocol</em>, defined by the
<code>Vehicle</code> and obligatory for all derived classes.
<p><br>The above class <code>VStorage</code> has just one disadvantage: when we add a
<code>Truck</code> object to a storage, then a code fragment like:
<pre>

    Vehicle const
        *any;
    VStorage
        garage;

    any = garage.getnext();
    cout &lt;&lt; any-&gt;getweight() &lt;&lt; endl;

</pre>

will <em>not</em> print the truck's combined weight of the cabin and the trailer.
Only the weight stored in the <code>Vehicle</code> portion of the truck will be
returned via the function <code>any-&gt;getweight()</code>.
Fortunately, there is a remedy against this slight disadvantage. 
This remedy will be discussed in the next chapter.
